Dramas are usually the most realistic and the most ordinary type of movies that you can go and see.

USER	Sure. It is an epic film, and to me, it doesn't do well with its epicness. It is rather ordinary, and the two main characters, while likable, would have been better suited for something of a smaller scale, despite the overall grand nature of the story they were trying to tell in the historical aspect. And the other thing is that it just	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3
USER	It's It's so such a over hyped movie and it's just, I don't know, ordinary. It's not something that's overly enjoyable and it's nothing that you want to keep watching over and over again.

SYSTEM	did you like it?	OTHER	
USER	I thought the Nolan does really well with sound design and manipulating you through sound and visual, but he broke it up the narrative of it and it was it was unnecessarily hard to follow. It made sense by the end, but it didn't help the story, and I thought it took away from what he was trying to get across.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,4,3
USER	And he kept taking me out of the movie, whereas some might say even Wright Ryan that is very impassive, I thought Don Cork was the opposite of that except for the sounds and it was shot well. But there is very little character development, I can't name you any other characters or really any of the stories of the characters were.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,4,4,3

Takes itself so seriously, but it it goes too far in trying to do that and imputes itself and	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	2,2,3
USER	And they also I I understand they're trying to do that to set themselves apart from Marvel, but I don't think they're being very successful. And Justice League felt like it wasn't earned. They didn't set up these characters very well. The only character that anybody really likes in them is the Wonder Woman I guess Superman to an extent, but the reason they tried to quickly cash in and catch up to Marvel and I think it	ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	2,2,3

You know, I think they're trying to offer something completely different, and sometimes it's just not the most simple story line,	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,4,3,3

USER	Sure. So like Love Adores is a easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is It has actually a very good cast, but the script and whatever they are trying to do in a movie is so flawed. That one is an approach where they have two women who are sort of friends and they are traveling together and they're	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,3
USER	embarking on sort of a new part of their life, but to say it doesn't work is an understatement. It's It's very bizarre. It sort of starts as like a romantic comedy and turns into a bit of a thriller, which It's based on a book, and I never read the book, so I don't think that's how the book turns out, but it's completely unexpected and not how they sold the movie. And So that was bad writing, really bad directing, and just a bad idea in general, despite having	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

USER	Mostly boys' school, girls', maybe getting into college, that kind of thing. But, they don't have a a ton of real life problems going on. So, it's pretty simple. And So But, there's still a lot you can do. And it's good for the audience because we all had to go through that time, so it's something easy to look back and laugh on. But, yeah. In the movie in particular, unknown to me, the girl who stars in it was really good. And really the	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

USER	Thou Be True, it's terrible.	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,4,3
SYSTEM	What are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?	OTHER	
USER	It was So part of the problem was how it was billed. It was billed as a romantic comedy. That's how they advertised it, that's how they showed it, and that's how they acted like it was going to be when they started the movie. But it was really more of a gross out comedy, which was kind of popular at the time, I guess. And So you went in expecting a romantic comedy, and you What was really happening was sort of like taking comedy to the extreme in a very	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,4,3
USER	funny and sort of gross out juvenile manner. It was a mess. The second thing I really hate about it really the lead actor. Gerard Butler is sorely miscast. He just is not good for romantic comedies at all. He doesn't pull off any aspect of what you want out of a romantic He's not like good at lighthearted. He's not funny. And I guess he's good looking, but it doesn't really	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+PERSON	3,3,3

USER	Sure. Just in general, the movie itself is poorly written. It's like it was	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,4,3
USER	I guess, I think probably trying too hard to be too many things, it certainly wasn't a romantic comedy and it was written in a way that one, I didn't laugh once, and two, the comedy they were going for was a wrong kind of comedy for romantic comedy.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

USER	It is	OTHER	3,4,3
USER	a really good ensemble cast. Sometimes it's hard to do an ensemble movie because there could be weak links throughout the cast, but this is one that is all around solid and the screenplay is exceptional.

SYSTEM	Last question: can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?	OTHER	
USER	I like action movies, and it's basically an action movie, so it has that sort of aspect of being exciting and kind of edge of your seat and you know, keeping you going from start to finish, so that's good. And then I do like the cast that they have in Jurassic World. I think they sort of I think they nailed it for sort of that sort of summer block	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	3,3,3
USER	so that's always great, and all of the Jurassic Park movies have fantastic visual effects, so it's a big budget movie. But it's big budget for a reason, they really get the feel of the dinosaurs and everything is so much more realistic than you'd think. And it really helps to carry off what they're going for in a movie.	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,4,3

USER	It's a controversial topic that is covering and it's trying to send a message about what they're doing now. It depicted a preachiness I think because that's what the journalists were doing but still came off a little bit that way but a really great movie and it doesn't take away from it.

SYSTEM	Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?	OTHER	
USER	Well, for this particular movie, the cast was perfect. Now you got the cast to be perfect because of the involvement of the actors in making the film, otherwise they would have gone for bigger names at the time, and a different cast, and it wouldn't have been such a good movie. That they came off as authentic to the Boston area was an important part of the movie. The script is great. The actors are excellent.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,4
USER	It's believable, and also really hopeful. They're original story, which is amazing. Really an amazing story that they came up with. And But also had moments of lightness to it that help balance out sort of the more serious journey that the movie takes you on.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,3
SYSTEM	Can you say a little more about that please?	OTHER	
USER	Sure, the movie itself is rather serious. It's taking, you know, a guy who was sort of ordinary and not making a ton of money to being someone who everybody wanted sort of a piece of to study because his mind was so amazing, and it had been discovered. So it's a very serious movie, but him dating Minnie Driver's character, his involvement	ENTITY_DESCRIPTION+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,3
USER	storyline with Robin Williams is extremely serious, given his background.

USER	Exceptional in that it doesn't try to do too much except what they are trying to do. They are two actors who are really they are focused on mostly on the two actors and then the four actors. They do it so well, the script is absolutely amazing, the direction is fantastic, it really doesn't try to be more than it is and it's totally charming and you can watch it a million times.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3
SYSTEM	Can you say a little more about that please?	OTHER	
USER	Sure. Some of the best movies ever made are fantastic, but you don't always want to watch them over and over and over again. When Harry Met Sally is the kind of movie that is fantastic, and as a romantic comedy, a little more approachable, a little more likable, and it's something you can watch many many times over the years. I've seen that more times than I can count, and even though I know what's going to happen, it's enjoyable every time.	ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

USER	I don't really like sci-fi movies.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	2,2,3,2
SYSTEM	Why not? Aren't they very popular?	OTHER	
USER	Sci-Fi movies are very popular. For me, Sci-Fi can be a little too high concept. And it's not always well thought out or well executed. There's a lot of times where I watch a Sci-Fi, and I'll think this doesn't make much sense. And so, it's hard to like something when it doesn't really sort of carry through on whatever claim it's making in the beginning. Sci-Fi really struggles with that. So, if they do it well	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	2,2,3,3
SYSTEM	okay, that's pretty reasonable. So what's a movie you've seen that you disliked?	OTHER	
USER	Like The Thirteenth Floor was not a good one. That's one where the concept Like till this day I still don't understand what they were trying to do.

And it wasn't confusing the entire	ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,2,3,3

And and that's one where I've talked to other people who saw and they're like I didn't get it either. So, it's just the confusion that comes with sci-fi. It ends up not being the best movie going experience because I guess it does great conversation, but it's not great to	ENTITY_OTHER+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,2,3,3
USER	our conversation when we're all wondering what they were trying to go for, cuz they didn't pull it off very well.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	So it's important for you to get movies so you can talk about them afterwords?	OTHER	
USER	It's good if you can talk about them afterwards, but it is just important to get it, so that it's sort of a satisfying movie-going experience, rather than a confusing one. You want to go to the movies, enjoy it, and be happy you went, instead of thinking, "I could've stayed home for all that.	OTHER	3,4,4,3

The I would say the biggest problem with the movie in general is just it's script isn't as good as the first one. So, maybe they need	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,2,3,3

SYSTEM	Why do you like these kinds of movies?	OTHER	
USER	I like them because I figure if I want to spend money in order to get into a movie, I want to have something that really resonates with me, something that I can really remember for a long time, cuz I don't tend to re-watch movies, either. So I really want the moviegoing experience to be an actual experience, so it has to be memorable and something where I can really take away something from the character interactions.

SYSTEM	What two things do you specifically appreciate about it?	OTHER	
USER	Sure, I think it has a really interesting sort of character. I mean, who really wants a character who can't really speak, but it was superbly acted by the female character,	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	4,3,3
USER	so it was a really good attention-grabbing thing in order to get people drawn into the story, and I also like the relationship that the two characters have with each other, the amphibian and as well as the newt lady, so I think it's quite nice and it also has some really good action, some really good tension going on, so I think overall, it's a pretty solid movie.

So it's really an experience you are not going to be you can really embrace yourself and and not think, "Oh, this is real life and it's about to happen."

ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3,4,3
USER	and I don't know. Let's say the movie is like 2 hours or 2 hours and 20 minutes or something. It feels like it goes by so quickly because it's just It has such a rhythm to it, and you're just immersed and involved with what's going on. And it's a character you can root for, and just people you like And this is a continuing series, so you really know the character already, and you're really there to root them on.

So, I don't like the joker character, it's not that bad. Keith Ledger was bad as the joker necessarily, not exactly, it's that it was not written very poorly. It was so dark.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,2,3,3
USER	So the two things I really don't like are it wasn't funny which is what the joke was supposed to be and the writing was extremely disappointing and very dark so just it was a a just bad all around for me.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3,4,3

So almost always they're comedies, and because they're high school based, they are or high school age based, it's a simpler time in almost everybody's life, so the movie is very focused, and it's much more contained, and it's in some ways easier to get right, so there are a decent number	ENTITY_DESCRIPTION+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	3,3,3,3

USER	Yes, and it was a good version of the DC movies. Movies like Suicide Squad, they struggle. I think they kind of fall into that Spider-Man thing where they throw too much at you or into their movies, and the tone is very dark, but Wonder Woman was not that.

It is actually a take off of a Shakespeare novel, and so the lead character is undercover impersonating her twin brother, and basically falls in love with another student who doesn't know that she's posing as a guy. And it's just a lot of fun. The actors are extremely likable.	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_OR_SERIES	3,3,3

USER	I don't dislike all sci-fi movies, but it's kind of particular which ones I like. I think the storylines can get very very complicated in a way that's almost unnecessary, like they should channel their focus more into one aspect or three aspects instead of you know, trying to tackle 20. And then sometimes I think about sci-fi, it's just you have to really stick the landing in the movie and	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	3,3,3

When it's lacking, the whole thing falls apart. So if it doesn't come together on almost every way the way other movies don't need to, maybe there's a bad character, a plot point that doesn't really make sense, but it's no big deal. In sci-fi, it has to all work	ENTITY_PREFERENCE+MOVIE_GENRE_OR_CATEGORY	3,3,3
