USER	Hello!		4,3,4,3
SYSTEM	hello!		
USER	I'm looking for some drama movie suggestions... I like romantic drama, etc. I loved "The Notebook (2004)" !		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Have you ever seen the movie "Veronica  (2017)"		
USER	I haven't, I'll give it a quick search though!		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Its not drama or romantic so you may not like it!		
USER	Oooh, that sounds great, and coincidentally, it's set in my birth year lol!		3,3,3,4
USER	The initial glance I got from IMDB has me intrigued!		3,4,4,3
USER	I always love horror thriller, etc, movies, and that says drama on IMDB, but looks like it could be a bit of both!		3,3,4,4
SYSTEM	im currently watching it now , its a top movie on Netflix based in Spain.		
USER	I'll have to queue it up!		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	oh! i loved the notebook!! Tyler Perrys "Why Did I Get Married%3F (2007)" was amazing!		
USER	I haven't seen "Why Did I Get Married%3F (2007)" but I've heard good things, I'll have to look into that one too! and yes, "The Notebook (2004)" was great!		4,4,4,4
SYSTEM	Its more of a horror based but its based on a true event in Spain and its really good so far!		
USER	Real quick, on Netflix, there are two movies titled Veronica, released in 2017, you know which one you're watching?		3,3,3,3
USER	It's the one about the seance in the school, correct?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	correct!		
USER	1 hours and 45 minutes?		3,3,3,3
USER	Okay cool, thanks!		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	i didnt even see another one titled Veronica when I did my search. My husband is the one who told me we had to watch it , he heard alot of good things about it from people and hes not even a horror fan.		
SYSTEM	Im a huge horror fan lol		
USER	Added "Veronica  (2017)" now! I love getting recommendations about unknown or lesser known movies! Got a couple more for me? ;)		3,3,3,3
USER	me too!		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	ive heard White Lady on Netflix is good as well! i have it in my que to watch after this		
SYSTEM	its a horror movie. its an older movie about a 10 year old boy who gets locked in the closet on halloween at school.		
USER	Is it in your DVD queue? I searched for White Lady and only found it for DVD. Is it "White Lady  (2006)"		3,3,3,3
USER	It sounds good!		4,4,4,4
SYSTEM	Nope I have it for streaming. i dont do the DVDs on Netflix.		
USER	Hmm, that's odd. I don't do the dvds either, but I typed in White Lady in my netflix search bar, and it said it is only available on DVD, and then showed me titles related, such as "White Girl  (2016)" etc		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes it should be "White Lady  (2006)"		
USER	I'll have to keep looking for it. Thanks for all of the suggestions though, I appreciate it!		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	hmm , thats odd, I wonder why its doing that!		
SYSTEM	No problem , your welcome! i love finding movies that arent overrated! : )		
USER	Me too!		3,4,3,4
USER	I hope you have a good night (or afternoon or morning!)		3,4,3,4
USER	Catch you later!		3,4,4,4

USER	Im not sure I have seen that one. I did like "A Walk to Remember (2002)" and the "The Notebook (2013)" though.		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Yes, they were both good movies. So was "Message in a Bottle  (1999)"		
USER	I haven't seen that one either. Which is better in your opinion "Dear John  (2010)" or "Message in a Bottle  (1999)"		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	I think "Dear John  (2010)" is slightly better but just like "A Walk to Remember (2002)" they are both sad at the end.		
USER	Who is in it?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Taten Chatem

SYSTEM	So many types of comedy. Do you like movies like "Anchorman " or "Hot Fuzz (2007)" ?		
USER	I have seen the a "Anchorman " I have not seen "Hot Fuzz (2007)" that sounds like a weird movie.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's from the guys who made "@182960," but about the police force.		
USER	I have not seen "Shaun of the Dead (2004)" either.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Well, i would add that to your list if you aren't grossed out by zombies or British humor.		
SYSTEM	haha		
SYSTEM	If you like 80s comedies, I would recommend "Trading Places (1983)" and "@172122."		
USER	I do not like zombies.		2,2,3
SYSTEM	Don't watch "Shaun of the Dead (2004)" then.		
USER	I have not seen "Trading Places (1983)" or "This Is Spinal Tap (1984)" but I have had a spinal tap and it was the worse thing ever.		2,3,3
USER	Especially because I have young kids that love to be with me all the time.		2,3,3

USER	I want to take some elementary school boys to the theater.		3,3,3
USER	I understand that I may be subjected to potty humor.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay, what movies do they like?		
USER	They liked movies like "Cars  (2006)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I know "Black Panther (2018)" is extremely popular, but not all boys are into superheros.		
SYSTEM	I like that one too.		
USER	but can probably move to something a little older now.		2,2,3
USER	PG 13 is too much.		3,2,2
USER	PG is fine.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	"Ferdinand (2017)" and "Early Man " are currently playing.		
USER	Is "Early Man " animated?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Peter Rabbit (2018)" is out, but I really did not care for it...it's fine for kids, but we adults must be able to tolerate the movie if we are sitting in the theater.		
USER	Is "Ferdinand (2017)" based on the kids book about a flower?		3,2,2
SYSTEM	I am not sure. I have not heard of it before this.		
SYSTEM	No. It's about a girl whose father is a Matador and comes home with a young bull		
SYSTEM	It looks cute, and one I wouldn't mind seeing myself.		
USER	I think "Early Man " is our best bet, but I will look at the "Ferdinand (2017)" trailer too.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	The main character is the bull		
SYSTEM	Okay		
SYSTEM	Enjoy!		
USER	The book is about a bull who smells flowers.		3,3,3

SYSTEM	You might like "@138284."		
USER	It is horror. I prefer "The Conjuring (2013)"		2,3,3,3
USER	I hate horror films with bad endings		2,3,3,3

USER	I didn't like that one		4,3,3
USER	But you gave me two good choices		4,3,4
USER	Thanks very much		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Really? I liked it a lot, but I was also a big fan of the book.

USER	Maybe I'll start that series, thank you. Maybe I'll rewatch some of Robin's old films like "Hook  (1991)" as well.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Sounds good. I hope I gave you some good ideas.

USER	like "The Martian  (2015)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "The Matrix (1999)" or "Event Horizon  (1997)" ?

USER	"The Matrix (1999)" was good		4,3,3
SYSTEM	How about "Pacific Rim  (2013)" ?		
USER	loved that one		4,3,3
USER	Something like that would be cool		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Nice, did you see the new "Kong: Skull Island (2017)" ?		
USER	no I didn't see that one		2,3,3
SYSTEM	It is great! If you like big monster movies, it is phenomenal.		
USER	I'll have to check it out I missed that one some how		4,3,3
USER	thanks		3,4,3
SYSTEM	No problem. Have a good one.		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello! What is the best movie you have seen recently?		
USER	I liked "It  (2017)" a lot.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Ooooh, the re-make? I haven't seen it yet. The original "It (1990)" was such a classic.		
SYSTEM	Are you a fan of Stephen King films?		
USER	I like horror movies		2,3,3
USER	I don't like a lot of Stephen King movies though		3,3,2
SYSTEM	They are hit-or-miss, aren't they? Some are really, really good like "The Shining  (1980)" and "The Shawshank Redemption (1994)" , but others are so awful, like "The Dark Tower  (2017)"		
USER	Yea I will just watch "The Shining  (1980)" again. That is a great movie.		3,3,3
USER	Thanks for the suggestions		3,3,3
SYSTEM	You're most welcome! Thanks for the chat.		
USER	Goodbye		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Bye		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

SYSTEM	good morning		
SYSTEM	what can I help you find this morning?		
SYSTEM	Do you have a favorite movie?		
SYSTEM	Maybe you like "Castaway  (1986)"		
USER	Good Morning - Yes, I have a favorite movie. Mine is "The Wizard of Oz  (1939)"		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Very good movie, started watching it at a young age.lol		
USER	I didn't really care for "Castaway  (1986)"		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Forrest Gump (1994)"		
USER	Of course. I'm not sure if I know anyone that hasn't seen "Forrest Gump (1994)"		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Or even "Steel Magnolias (1989)"		
SYSTEM	I will agree with you on that.		
SYSTEM	"Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)" is like the wiszord of Oz I do think		
USER	"Steel Magnolias (1989)" is an oldie but good one. What about "I Can Only Imagine (2018)" ? I think it is still in theater's but I want to see it.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I have not seen it .		
USER	"Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)" is a spin off of "The Wizard of Oz  (1939)" . It's definitely different.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh was not sure, as my kids told me about it a while ago.		
SYSTEM	I hope I helped you somewhat?		
SYSTEM	Did you like "Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)"		
USER	My kids are stuck on watching "Moana  (2016)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	LOL		
SYSTEM	have not herd of that one either.		
USER	"Oz the Great and Powerful (2013)" was an odd one for sure. It's a spin off of "The Wizard of Oz  (1939)" but also has a completely different story line.		3,3,2,3
USER	"Moana  (2016)" is really pretty cute. If you have small kids it's worth watching. Between that and "Cars  (2006)" - both of which I get to watch at least once a week. LOL		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I loved "Finding Nemo (2003)"		
SYSTEM	and "Finding Dory (2016)"		
USER	Me too. Have you seen "Finding Dory (2016)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	yes, was so cute..Loved it.		
SYSTEM	Can I help you with any more suggestions today?		
USER	I actually really enjoy horror movies, but my kids didn't sleep in their own beds for a week after "Annabelle 2 (2017)" so no more of that.		3,3,5,3
SYSTEM	LOL...If you like Steven king watch "Pet Sematary  (1989)" ...NO kids..lol		
USER	Oh I've seen "Pet Sematary  (1989)" . Good one		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	yes if you dont have pets, that will get the hair on your back standing up		
USER	"Ouija  (2014)" was dumb. It was almost as bad "The Blair Witch Project (1999)"		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Aggreed.		
SYSTEM	Dumb		
SYSTEM	"Misery  (1990)"		
SYSTEM	oh my that one is a good night time movie.		
USER	I'm not sure if I've seen "Misery  (1990)" or not. Probably so, but I've watched so many I can't think of all the names. lol		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I'm a junkie fan of horror , love ghost movies.		
SYSTEM	I agree I have watched so many also that I forget then sometimes.		
SYSTEM	"Bates Motel " is a long running one but I like it as a filler movie.		
USER	Same here. I think we're done. What do you say?		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Im good , so nice to chat. Hope you find a great one to watch this weekend. Thanks again.

SYSTEM	I am doing great, thanks.		
SYSTEM	How can I help you with today?		
USER	Need to think about a good movie in something I'm not used to see. Just to mix it up a bit		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Zero Days (2016)" ?		
USER	Zero Days? Whats it about?		2,2,3,2
SYSTEM	Fascinating film about two tech employees in the Bay area who happened to discover a fatal malware created by the US government and Israeli to insert this virus into the computers of the Iranian government nuclear program and to dismantle it. However, it can operate on its own and do what it does.		
USER	Sounds like non-Fiction.		3,2,3,2
SYSTEM	Pretty much film goes on to say this malware or virus is out there and can shut down the entire continent power grid.		
USER	That's like something I would see. Good suggestion. Now I just have to find it on streaming.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	It is worth the watch. This malware is out of the box and is worst than a nuclear missile in my own opinion.		
SYSTEM	I think Amazon should carry it.		
USER	I will give it a look.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Another film is "Hacksaw Ridge" by Mel Gibson and it is worth the time and money.		
USER	I haven't seen that one either. Award winning I think		3,2,2,3
SYSTEM	A great film to watch and be carried away from the busy life.		
USER	These are two good suggestions. "Zero Days (2016)" sounds like the winner		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Another suggestion is "The Darkest Hour  (2011)" which is about Winston Churchill I just finished watching. Amazing is all I can say.		
SYSTEM	I think the year is wrong it barely came out last year.		
SYSTEM	Is there anything else I can help you with?		
USER	I have that movie. It was good.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	I am glad I can help.		
SYSTEM	Bye		
USER	I think this was a good chat. Thanks again!		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Another film is "The Croods (2013)" which is really funny and fun to watch with family.		
USER	Okay I will check that out too.		3,3,3,4
USER	Thanks for all of these.		3,3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3,4

USER	Hi, good afternoon		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hey it's a great day for a movie. What kind do you like?		
USER	I would like a comedy		3,3,4
USER	I like robin williams so it would have to be a movie i can get on DVD		4,3,4
SYSTEM	Comedy is great ! Have you seen "Deadpool  (2016)" ?		
SYSTEM	Oh ok Robin Williams no problem. I would suggest "Flubber  (1997)" it's one of his older classics.		
USER	"Jack  (1996)" and "Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)" are two of my favorites.		3,3,3
USER	I really don't have no interest in Deadpool. I'm sorry		3,3,1
SYSTEM	"Hook  (1991)" is another classic of his and you can get it on DVD.		
USER	I seen Flubber too and liked it.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Patch Adams  (1998)" is more on the emotional side but full of laughs. You can also get on DVD.		
USER	I haven't seen Hook. That sounds like a winner in my book. I'll see if I can find it.		3,3,3
USER	Yes, I seen Patch Adams. I think that was a cry for help on his part.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	"Jack  (1996)" is also another Robin Williams classic you can also get on DVD.		
USER	Poor man made us all laugh but was dying inside. It's so sad.		3,3,3
USER	Yes, Jack was one of my favorites as I mentioned.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes "Patch Adams  (1998)" has it's sad moments.		
USER	I'm going to go try to find Hook. Thank you for the recommendation. Goodbye		4,3,4
SYSTEM	I'm glad I was able to help you find a good movie and you have a awesome day!		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4

SYSTEM	Hi! What are your favorite movie genres?		
USER	I love them all. so any suggestion is good.		3,3,3
USER	I loved "Drive  (2011)" but also love movies like "Despicable Me (2010)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	How about a classic, like "@87490?"		
SYSTEM	It's dark but funny.		
USER	I have not seen it. that is a good reminder to watch it.		4,2,4
SYSTEM	Or you could go all the way dark with "@103743."		
USER	I like that movie.		4,3,4
USER	Very creepy though.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	Or to a light-hearted film, (which is also animated) "The Road to El Dorado (2000)"		
USER	I think I may have seen it, hard to remember now. I like the suggestion .. I htink I DI SEE IT. IT WAS CUTE.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh yes... "A Clockwork Orange  (1971)" is very creepy and dark.		
USER	Oh god sorry about that typing mess.		2,2,3

USER	Lol		3,3,3
USER	Well thanks for the great recommendations.		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Have you ever seen "The Road  (2009)" ? It's probably the darkest movie I have ever seen.		
USER	Oh ya, it is dark, good book too.		4,3,4
SYSTEM	Yes! I loved the book. I ended up buying it.		
USER	I think "Requiem for a Dream (2000)" was really dark.		3,3,3
USER	but very good.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	I've never seen it but I've heard about it.		
SYSTEM	I want to see it.		
USER	It is intense		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you ever seen "The Deer Hunter (1978)" ?		
USER	After it was done I just sat on my couch for ten minutes.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's very dark and intense!		
USER	It sounds familar.		3,3,3
USER	I am not sure IF i have seen it or not.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's about a bunch of Pennsylvania blue collar workers sent to Vietnam.		
USER	I will have to look it up and rewatch and see.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	But it's different than the standard flicks.		
USER	Thanks for the nightmares, jk , great picks.		4,3,4
SYSTEM	Try it. It's realistic and dark. It makes you think more than any other Vietnam movie I've seen.		
SYSTEM	Thanks!		
USER	Bye.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have fun with the films! Bye!		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4

SYSTEM	I don't really care for "Paranormal Activity (2007)" though. How about you?		
USER	I haven't checked out "The Conjuring (2013)" I'll have to try that		3,3,3
USER	"Paranormal Activity (2007)" isn't really my type of horror either, reminded me of "The Blair Witch Project (1999)" which I hated		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I love the whole "Saw  (2003)" series!		
USER	Oh, I've been watching the "Saw  (2003)" lately! I very much enjoy that also		3,4,4

USER	and not comedy, but proper drama		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I have a great movie for you to watch with a strong female lead.		
SYSTEM	The movie is entitled "Black Swan  (2010)" with Natalie Portman, it's an amazing film.		
SYSTEM	Or you could watch "Kill Bill" with Uma Thurman, it's a very good movie.

SYSTEM	Oh, I know, I saw a really good movie directed by David Lynch called "Mulholland Drive  (2001)" it stars Naomi Watts		
USER	oh I've also seen that, also a bit creepy, since it's lynch		3,3,3,3
USER	got anything else? perhaps more uplifting?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	An even better film would be "The Silence of the Lambs  (1991)" with Jodie Foster		
USER	lol, true, but also creepy		3,3,4,3
USER	I was thinking more along the lines of "Amelia  (2009)"		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Chinatown  (1974)" with Faye Dunaway is a great film, you should watch that.		
USER	I thought a guy is the lead? jack nicholson?		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	what genres are you into

USER	got any suggestions for things like that?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	I see. What about "The Usual Suspects (1995)" ?		
USER	Kaiser Soze...although now that has a bit of a tainted experience with Kevin Spacey		4,3,4,4
USER	I do love that movie..		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Yeah. Hated to hear the latest news about his past. Sucks. But he's a phenomenal actor.		
USER	i agree...one of the best.		3,3,4,3
USER	do yu have another suggestions for something similiar to those		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Have you seen "@Seven" or "L.A. Confidential  (1997)" ?		
SYSTEM	Spacey's in both		
USER	I have seen Seven..one of his best performances. unrecognizable! I didn't see La Confidential though		3,3,3,4
USER	Maybe I will heck that one out		3,3,2,3
USER	my spelling is atrocious today		3,3,2,2
SYSTEM	Mine was like that earlier, lol

USER	OVERALL		4,3,4,4

SYSTEM	Hi		
SYSTEM	How are you today?		
USER	Hi there.		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	What kind of movies do you like?		
USER	I like horror and suspense		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	Nice! I love horror movies too. Have you watched "A Quiet Place (2018)" ? One of the best movies i've ever seen!		
SYSTEM	It's so different from all the other movies		
USER	No, I haven't heard of it, but I'm willing to try it out.		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	It just came out. It's really good. I wouldn't say it's super scary but it's very interesting		
SYSTEM	Also, have you watched "Happy Death Day  (2017)" ?		
USER	Nope! Willing to, but never heard of it either.		4,4,2,4
SYSTEM	Again, it isn't that scary but it's good. It depends on what kind of horror movies you like. Do you like movies with a lot of blood like "Jigsaw (2017)" or ghost movies like "Paranormal Activity (2007)"		
USER	Oh my Jigsaw scares me, but I will definitely watch		3,5,3,3
USER	Paranormal activity, meh. Didn't care for it. Seemed too staged.		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	I recently watched "Insidious: Chapter 4 (2018)" . It's very scary! It's about the lady who can feel or see ghosts		
USER	Oh man, I can't! Super scary		2,5,2,2
USER	But hey, I think I'm good now.		3,5,3,3
USER	I appreciate your suggestions!		4,5,4,4

SYSTEM	Hello		
SYSTEM	what kind of movies do you like?		
USER	Hello,		3,3,3
USER	I like romantic movies if you have any suggestions.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Have you watched "Beauty and the Beast  (2017)" ?		
USER	Oh yes it was so good.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I haven't seen it, I heard it was		
SYSTEM	How about "Fifty Shades Darker  (2017)" ?		
USER	The music was awesome.		2,4,2
SYSTEM	Or "Slumdog Millionaire (2008)" ?		
USER	Haven't seen that one. Is it good?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It looks good, I haven't seen it		
SYSTEM	It gets 4 stars		
SYSTEM	It's about an orphan		
USER	The "Fifty Shades Freed  (2018)" is out now		2,4,2
SYSTEM	Rotten Tomatoes gives it 92%		
USER	A movie about an orphan might be too sad for me		2,2,3
SYSTEM	It has millionaire in the title so it must not be too sad LOL		
USER	True, i may need to look that one up.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	There's the "The Shape of Water  (2017)"		
USER	I haven't heard of that one.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	It's rated R		
USER	Those are good suggestions, I need to really get out more.		3,2,2
USER	R ratings are ok.		2,2,3
SYSTEM	"Call Me by Your Name  (2017)" is a romance		
USER	As long as no horror. Can't do those at all. That sounds like an interesting one.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	It's about a 17-year old in Italy who falls in love with a visiting research assistant for her father		
USER	Well that is definitely my kind of movie.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Oops, it's about 2 guys I think		
SYSTEM	Here's a good one --		
SYSTEM	"Shakespeare in Love (1998)"		
USER	OH well that may not work. Same sex is not my thing. Now "Shakespeare in Love (1998)" sounds good.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	It's about a young Shakespeare with writer's block, and he is called Will not William, he's writing Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter and can't make progress on the work		
SYSTEM	I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil the plot...		
USER	That sounds good. I think I will look that one up to watch.		3,3,4
USER	Thanks so much for the suggestions.		4,4,4
SYSTEM	OK I hope you have a good day and you're very welcome, bye		
USER	You have a good day too. Bye.		3,4,3
USER	OVERALL		2,2,3

USER	Hey there!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Would you care to see come classic comedy?		
USER	Sure!		3,4,3
USER	Shoot it.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Try "The Big Lebowski" you may like it		
SYSTEM	"Airplane! (1980)" is also funny		
USER	I can only recommend one movie to watch for you right now, its "The Revenant  (2015)" . I can't believe that movie came out almost three years ago my friend.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Blazing Saddles (1974)" is even funnier		
USER	I havent watched those movie which is sad.		3,3,3
USER	I would definitely check those out!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	You can do an experiment		
SYSTEM	watch "Ghostbusters (1984)"		
SYSTEM	Then watch "Ghostbusters  (2016)"		
USER	A timeless classic.		3,4,3

SYSTEM	Hi! What type of genre are you interested in		
USER	I enjoy comedies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Who's your favorite comedian actor?		
USER	Oh my that is a hard one but I will go with Seth Rogen.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	He is a very good actor. I like "Neighbors  (2014)" with him in it		
USER	That was surprisingly good. My favorite is "Knocked Up (2007)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	That one was good. I also like "The Night Before  (2015)"		
USER	I didn't watch that one all the way through.		3,3,3
USER	I don't think I liked it too much.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	I liked it but I like cheesy humor lol. Did you like "Sausage Party" ? One of my friends liked it but i havent seen it yet		
USER	It was kinda too stupid for me but maybe I wasn't in the right state of mind then.		2,2,3
SYSTEM	Yeah it seemed a little strange		
USER	"Sausage Party" I mean, was not funny. I hate to say it. lol		4,3,3
USER	I enjoy his voice acting on "Monsters vs. Aliens (2009)"		3,2,3
SYSTEM	I love that movie! lol and the blob was probably my favorite		
USER	Bob just seems so blissfully unaware. I would like to be him sometimes.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	haha right! Well have a good day!		
USER	Thanks! you too!		3,2,3
USER	OVERALL		3,2,3

SYSTEM	Hello.		
USER	Hi!		3,3,4
USER	I am looking for a fun action movie to watch.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Do you have anything in mind you would like some suggestions for?		
SYSTEM	Good category. Just a second.		
SYSTEM	I'm going to assume you've watched the "The Avengers  (2012)" movies so I'll go to something different. Have you seen "Justice League: Gods and Monsters (2015)" ?		
USER	I have not seen Justice League, but I have no interest in that.		3,3,3
USER	I liked Avengers. Just not into DC movies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Con Air (1997)" or "Skyfall (2012)" ?		
SYSTEM	I see. I'm the same way actually. I just don't like the DC universe.		
USER	Not Con Air, but sounds interesting.		3,3,4
USER	I liked Skyfall. Best Bond movie.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Do you have any interest in movies like "Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)" ?		
USER	I loved Kingsman, but have not seen the sequel, "@197589," yet.		3,4,3
USER	Want to see it though!		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I thought it was a great movie even though I'm not normally interest in those sorts of story lines. This movie is a little older but I thought "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  (2009)" the original was good.		
USER	You liked the Swedish or American version better?		3,3,3
USER	I haven't seen either but I'm interested!		4,3,4
SYSTEM	American. I've never seen the Swedish version. Maybe I should watch it.		
SYSTEM	Cool. I hope you like some of those.		
USER	Definitely, thank you for your help!		4,5,4
SYSTEM	Have a good weekend. Goodbye		
USER	OVERALL		4,4,4

USER	Hi! I am looking for a classic movie to enjoy with my Grandfather, can you suggest a few?		4,4,3
SYSTEM	Ok		
SYSTEM	How about "Man of the West (1958)"		
USER	Is it a John Wayne?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Or "Meet the Fockers (2004)"		
SYSTEM	Yes the western is :)		
USER	I don't think "Meet the Fockers (2004)" would be a good choice.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	And "Countryman  (1982)" is good too		
USER	Do you know of any modern westerns?		3,3,3
USER	What is that one about?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Just a good old western type movie		
SYSTEM	Hey "Back to the Future (1985)" is a fun family movie		
USER	That wouldn't work either.		2,2,1
SYSTEM	Theres even a western one haha		
USER	"Man of the West (1958)" it is.		3,3,3
USER	Thank you for your help		4,3,3
USER	Bye.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Awesome		
SYSTEM	Bye now :)

USER	I'm looking for something kind of like "The Hunger Games  (2012)" but not like "The Maze Runner  (2014)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Divergent  (2014)"		
USER	I have not but I did read them and after the first one I sort of lost interest		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	It has a sequel "The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015)" and "The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016)" aren't as good as the first.		
USER	Same page then!		4,3,3,3
USER	Great, what else can you recommend?		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	The first one had such hope, then it all just fell apart.		
SYSTEM	There is a Japanese film called "Battle Royale  (2000)"		
SYSTEM	They say it's what the "The Hunger Games  (2012)" is based on.		
SYSTEM	A bunch of kids are sent to an island to fight to the death.		
USER	I love Battle Royale!		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's pretty chilling, but still entertaining.		
SYSTEM	Too bad there is no sequel.		
SYSTEM	Well it was great chatting with you!		
USER	Same !		4,4,3,3
USER	Bye!		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	Bye!		
USER	OVERALL		3,5,3,3

SYSTEM	hi

USER	I really liked "@184098." Do you know of any like that?		3,3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	No is it like "Star Wars" ?		
USER	No I really don't like "@204292." It's more of a super hero movie.		3,2,3,2,3
USER	What about "@173575?"		3,3,5,3,3
USER	Can you suggest something like that.		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I really like despicable me. You have "Minions  (2015)" movies		
USER	I really didn't care for "Minions  (2015)"		3,1,3,1,3
SYSTEM	"The Secret Life of Pets (2016)"		
USER	Oh that sounds good. I'll watch that! Thanks.		4,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	No problem, enjoy your night, bye!		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3,3,4

SYSTEM	What movies do you like to watch?		
USER	Hi have you seen "@203730.I" am good and i watch a little of eveything		3,3,3,3
USER	I aso love "Godfather  (1991)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I think I did. Have you watched "A Quiet Place (2018)" ? It just came out and it's SO good!		
SYSTEM	It's really different from all the other movies in this genre		
SYSTEM	i don't like "Godfather  (1991)" , not the type of movies i like :)		
USER	Yes i have have you watched "Deadpool  (2016)"		3,2,3,2
SYSTEM	If you like "Rocky (1976)" you should check out "Creed  (2015)" . It's a boxing movie. Really good		
SYSTEM	I don't like "Deadpool  (2016)" ! His jokes are nasty.		
USER	I love that movie cant wait to see "@204870." I saw creed it was amazing		2,4,4,2
USER	That is true but its still a funny movie		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I probably won't even watch "Deadpool 2  (2018)" because of his jokes.		
SYSTEM	Have you watched "Black Panther (2018)" ?		
USER	Yes it was amazing did you like it		3,4,4,4
SYSTEM	yes! Really good. Love the cast!		
USER	Yes quite perfect way better than "Justice League  (2017)"		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Have you watched "It  (2017)" ? Not as good as original but if you like horror movies you should check this movie out		
SYSTEM	"Justice League  (2017)" was really boring. I didn't like it. I don't like DC characters. I love Marvel		
USER	Yes i have love the original more too		3,3,4,4
USER	That is true marvel will always be better		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	How about "Love, Simon (2018)" ?		
USER	That is a decent movie but not the greatest		3,3,3,3
USER	What are your thoughts on it		3,3,4,3

SYSTEM	Hi, What kind of movies do you like?		
USER	I'm looking for some good drama movies. Any suggestions?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	hmm		
USER	Something like "The Green Mile  (1999)"		3,3,3,3
USER	or "The Shawshank Redemption (1994)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I saw "The Judge  (2014)" recently, with RDJ.		
USER	I've never seen that movie, what is it about?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	That movie doesn't have a supernatural element though.		
USER	It doesn't need to have a supernatural element.		2,2,3,3
SYSTEM	It's about a son's strained relationship with his father, a small town judge.		
USER	Just something with dort of a drama/thriller vibe		3,3,3,3
USER	Hmm, it sounds pretty good, I'll make sure to check it out		3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	The son must defend his father on a murder allegation.		
SYSTEM	not really a thriller though		
USER	I also love "Forrest Gump (1994)" and "Pulp Fiction (1994)"		3,3,3,3
USER	What about action movies? Any suggestions?		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	How about a 90s thriller: "@154857."		
USER	I love that movie!		3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	Who doesn't?		
USER	Ha very true		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	How About "@86449," That's a 90s thriller. It's about a vast conspiracy on the Intenet, with very outdated technology.		
USER	I've never heard of that movie		3,3,3,3
USER	Do you like it?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	And probably where we get a lot of incorrect hacker stereotypes		
SYSTEM	it's fun. It's not good. I like it.		
USER	Fun? Well I will definitely check that out		3,4,3,4
USER	Have you seen "Catch Me If You Can (2002)" ?		3,3,3,3
USER	That's another great movie		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes. That one is good.		
SYSTEM	My friend used to quote DiCaprio from it a lot.		
SYSTEM	I forgot what he said though.		
USER	What about "American History X (1998)" with Edward Norton? That's another good drama movie		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I kind of don't want to see it because it sounds really graphic. But it has been suggested to me a lot.		
USER	Understandable.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	How do you feel about "Good Will Hunting (1997)" ?		
USER	Thats a love and hate movie		3,4,3,3
USER	Some parts are really good, but some parts are so boring		3,2,3,2
SYSTEM	It's good, but maybe unrealistic.		
USER	Very true		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's hard to believe anyone is a genius the way Matt Damon's character is.		
USER	Right?! I totally agree		3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	But I just love the monologue where he interviews with the NSA.		
USER	Same. But I hate the part where Robin Williams says it's not your fault like 20 times		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah. That became a meme. Also, it makes me miss Robin Williams.		
USER	True		3,3,3,3
USER	Well, thank you for the suggestions, I'll make sure to look into that. Goodnight		3,3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4,3

USER	Good morning!		3,5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hi! What type of movies do you prefer&gt;		
USER	I'm looking for something scary. Blood and gore is okay, but I'd rather have a good story than a good slasher film.		3,3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Ok. Hmm. This is a bit difficult for me. I could suggest "Mother! (2017)" although I did not like it.		
USER	"Mother! (2017)" looked good, what did you not like about it?		3,5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Very disjointed in a way that I found boring. I was wondering if my younger self would have found it profound. However, I can always throw back to "@202190." Or "Psycho  (1960)"		
SYSTEM	I am not that old.		
USER	Ohh....those are good ones. I'm watching "The Purge: Anarchy (2014)" right now and it's horrible.		2,2,2,2,4
SYSTEM	A bad movie can be fun. And a good documentary like "Blackfish  (2013)" can be frightening.		
USER	I'll definitely check that one out!		3,3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	How about "The Blair Bitch Project (1999)" ? Did you see that? Sadly, I din't think the creators went on to much success with other films.		
SYSTEM	Yikes. The drop down menu has that misspelled!		
USER	Ehh....I lived in a small town when "The Blair Witch Project (1999)" came out and by the time it made it to our theater I'd already seen all the parodies of it. And it was in a theater full of people who screamed and freaked out. I think If I'd seen it earlier then I'd have liked it.		3,3,3,2,3
USER	LOL		3,3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	That's an interesting timeline. I had never thought of the time effect. Should we say good-bye?		
USER	I wasn't really a fan of "Paranormal Activity (2007)" either. Yes, I think so. This is my first time doing these, so I'm still learning the process.		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Me too. I am very jet lagged from returning from a vacation in Asia so my thinking skills might be a bit impaired.		
USER	Well, it was nice talking to you. Get some rest and have a good day.		3,5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	You were a lot of fun and made my tired brain think! Have a great day! Bye!		
USER	OVERALL		4,4,4,4,3

USER	Hello, I am looking for a mystery movie. Can you help me?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Identity  (2003)"		
USER	No, I haven't, is it a good movie?		3,2,3
SYSTEM	its really good, the ending is twisted and crazy

SYSTEM	Do you know any good SciFi movies?		
USER	"Independence Day  (2000)" and "Men in Black  (1997)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Men in Black  (1997)" is a funny one. I think about "Blade Runner 2049 (2017)" more than I expected.		
USER	I haven't seen "Blade Runner (1982)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I do not watch enough Romantic Comedies to recommend one.		
USER	Okay. I might try "Blade Runner (1982)" if it is good		3,3,3

SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" was pretty good		
USER	What animal was in "Get Out (2017)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	my favorite horror films are "House of 1000 Corpses (2003)" and "The Devil's Rejects (2005)"

SYSTEM	i am no help today lol

USER	Hello. I've been hoping to find a movie similar to "Alien  (1979)" or "Halloween  (1978)"		4,3,3
SYSTEM	How about "A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)"		
USER	I loved that series as well.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes it was great. Have you seen the "Friday the 13th  (1980)" series?		
USER	I've watched it though I just wasn't into it as much		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah I can understand that. It was a little different. What about "The Thing  (1982)"		
USER	Yes that was a fun one! Also "The Blob  (1988)" was fun		4,4,3
SYSTEM	I have not seen "@93402." What about "Life  (2017)"		
USER	I haven't seen that one yet. I liked "Happy Death Day  (2017)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I tried watching that but the movie malfunctioned		
SYSTEM	You could try "10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)"		
USER	lol. It's really entertaining. Probably my favorite movie of the year		4,3,3
USER	I want to watch that one.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah I was really bummed I couldn't watch it		
SYSTEM	Yeah "10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)" was pretty good, I think you would like it

USER	Hi there!!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hello!		
SYSTEM	What kind of movie are you looking for?		
USER	I'm in the mood for a good horror film today.		3,3,3
USER	Can you help me?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes. Have you seen "The Babadook (2014)" ? It's very unique and a bit odd but overall very scary		
USER	No I haven't. But I've heard good things about it. That's its very psychological		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I loved it! Have you seen "A Tale of Two Sisters (2003)"		
SYSTEM	I also liked that one. I thought it was super scary		
SYSTEM	And of course, there is "The Shining  (1980)" but I'm sure you've seen it		
USER	Yes, I've seen "The Shining  (1980)" . I wonder why they don't make horror films as suspenseful anymore.		3,3,3
USER	Maybe because we're so de-sensitized to everything.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I don't know. It's very frustrating. The new ones all seem to have little plot		
SYSTEM	I also would recommend "Hush  (2016)" .		
USER	I agree. They seem to be more about jumps and scares than anything		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen that one?		
USER	No I have not		3,3,3
USER	Is it good?		3,3,3
USER	A good plot i mean		4,3,3
SYSTEM	You should check it out! I thought it had a very indepth plot that moved at a good pace		
SYSTEM	I watched it with my grandfather and he enjoyed it too		
USER	I'll definitely take a look. Thanks :)		3,3,4
SYSTEM	No worries! Have a great day		
SYSTEM	I hope you like it		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4

SYSTEM	"It  (2017)" is a great movie choice		
USER	I've watched "It  (2017)" i think it was really good but i love the original "It (1990)"		3,4,3
SYSTEM	oh ok		
USER	i'm definitely not into movies with a lot of blood like "Saw  (2004)" . Those makes me wanna throw up		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Blair Witch  (2016)" is a good scary movie		
USER	I've watched it. I wasn't a big fan of it		3,2,3
SYSTEM	ok		
USER	I don't think it was scary		3,2,3
SYSTEM	oh		
USER	any other suggestions?		3,2,3
SYSTEM	"Carrie  (1976)" is a good film		
USER	Oh, what is it about? I don't think i've watched it		3,3,3
SYSTEM	its about stephen kings horror novel, where carrie white faces taunting from classmates at school and asbuse from her mother and she begins to suspect that she has supernatural powers		
USER	wow! sounds really interesting. I love Stephen King's movies and books		3,3,4

USER	pretty good lol		4,4,2

USER	same. i dont think they offer 3d movies much anymore.		2,3,3
SYSTEM	There are. But of course you don't care for superhero films.		
USER	i wont say that. just not a fan of them but i watched "Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)" and i liked it. wasnt as cheesy as other films		3,3,2
SYSTEM	LOVED that movie. I'm so looking forward to "@Avengers" Infiniti War		
USER	yah. me too.		4,3,3
USER	and "@Black" Panther.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Me too. So you DO have a fondness for superheros. lol		
USER	some, ya, but not many		3,2,3
USER	i cant stand the "Iron Man  (2008)" . none of them		3,3,2
SYSTEM	The first two were great. The third, not so much. It felt like they did it for the sake of doing it.		
USER	yah. I kinda feel that way about "Thor: Ragnarok (2017)" and "Thor: The Dark World"		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Well to be fair, those have a place in the cinematic universe. not so much with "Iron Man 3"

SYSTEM	Hello, How are you?		
SYSTEM	Hello! Do you have any recommendations for horror movies?		
USER	one movie i would recommend you stay away from is "It  (2017)" . it is not as good as the original "It (1990)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I saw "It  (2017)" it was really good, but not as scary as "Insidious  (2011)"		
USER	One I did enjoy that is newer is "Happy Death Day  (2017)" .		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I have not yet seen that one!		
SYSTEM	Thank you for the suggestion!		
USER	Oh its good. Its about a girl who dies, but she relives her death until she figures it out. SUPER GOOD		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Sounds really good! Have you seen "Annabelle  (2014)" ?		
USER	OMG that dang doll scares me		3,2,3
SYSTEM	Yeah! It is really scary! I didnt like it very much because of that		
USER	one good scary movie, but might ruin board games is "Ouija  (2014)" scared the crap out of me		3,3,3

USER	Hi		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hi! How are you this afternoon?		
USER	Great. What would you recommend in terms of a great sci-fi movie?		3,4,3
USER	Like "Gravity  (2013)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Blade Runner 2049 (2017)" is a great choice		
SYSTEM	Also I loved "Life  (2017)"		
USER	Seen it and it was a good movie. Though it wouldn’t be.		3,3,3
USER	I be seen life		3,2,3
USER	I have		3,2,3
USER	Didn’t really like it that much though.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	"The Martian  (2015)" and "Interstellar  (2014)" are good choices too.		
USER	Seen them both.		3,2,3
USER	I also enjoyed "Apollo 13  (1995)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	That was good as well. There's the sequel "@187344."		
USER	Really?		3,3,3
USER	That movie was based on a true story.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Well that's what the marketing calls it anyway.		
USER	What’s it about? Another Apollo malfunction in space?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	No it was the Apollo mission successfully made it to the moon but the astronauts were attacked by moon creatures.		
USER	No it’s not the sequel because the first movie is based on real events and not a horror movie.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	I thought it was actually pretty well done for a found footage style movie.		
USER	Thanks for the suggestions and I might just give it a watch.		3,3,4
USER	Bye		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Sure! Have a great day!		
USER	OVERALL		3,2,3

SYSTEM	Hello!		
USER	Hi there!		3,3,3,3
USER	Can you help me find some gorey movies?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay. Have you seen "@88141?" It has one scene that is.		
USER	No, I haven't. I was leaning more towards horror films that are filled with gore.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay. I know "Underworld: Evolution (2006)" has a lot but not sure it's horror.		
USER	Haven't watched that one. Do you know what it's about?		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Vampires and the like.		
SYSTEM	It's pretty much one super powerful vampire goes on the war path to free his werewolf brother. Another vampire, werewolf and a team of humans have to stop him.		
USER	Thank you for the explanation.		4,4,2,4
SYSTEM	"Cyborg X" is a sci fi but fits with what you want.		
USER	Never heard of it, I'll check it out!		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I found it on Amazon Video by accident.		
SYSTEM	"Lord of Illusions (1995)" is a horror but mild compared to the others.		
SYSTEM	That I mentioned of course.

SYSTEM	"The Impossible  (2012)" is supposed to be really good but heart wrenching		
USER	I have seen "Schindler's List (1993)" but that's just too sad. It reflects on how horrible humanity is. It's depressing.		3,3,4
USER	I haven't seen that one yet!		3,3,3

USER	ok		3,3,3

USER	I also loved the "Home Alone (1990)" series		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I really enjoy "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992)" as well! We laugh while watching it every year		
SYSTEM	"Home Alone 3 (1997)" was super lame and I do not reccomend that!		
USER	I agree completely even my kids didn't like "Home Alone 3 (1997)"		4,3,3

USER	Hello, I am looking for a good Sci-Fi movie		3,3,4
USER	I really liked "Ghost in the Shell  (2017)"		3,4,4
USER	Scarlett johansson was really good in it.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I feel like I have watched a few lately. Have you seen "Altered Carbon (2018)" on Netflix?		
SYSTEM	Its very "Blade Runner (1982)" like		
USER	not yet, that sounds interesting.		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Its a TV show though		
SYSTEM	Im not finished with it but so far its great		
USER	I watched "Blade Runner 2049 (2017)" the other day and really enjoyed it		4,4,4
USER	I also like "Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)" which maybe is not a sci-fi but I like that gritty style		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I havent seen the new "Blade Runner 2049 (2017)" yet but "Altered Carbon (2018)" builds a really cool futureistic world		
USER	It looks really cool, I'm surprised I never heard of it.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Its got bounty hunters and reincarnation elements		
SYSTEM	The special effects are incredible for Netflix show		
SYSTEM	Again Im a little more than half way through and its very inticate		
USER	Can you recommend anything that is a movie that is similar?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Definitely one you have to pay attention to because there is so much going on.		
SYSTEM	Possibly the older "RoboCop (1987)"		
SYSTEM	The whole vigilante theme		
USER	Nice I will check out the old "RoboCop (1987)" I remember I had seen one of them but it's been so long.		3,4,4
USER	I will defiantly check out the other mention, but I just wanted to see movies for now.		3,4,4
SYSTEM	They both are about a man looking into a crime then going off on their own agenda because things keep unraveling into deeper issues		
USER	Sounds, great! Exciting! Can't wait to watch it. Thank you so much.		3,3,4
USER	Have a nice day! Goodbye :)		4,4,4
SYSTEM	Also check out "Dredd (2012)"

SYSTEM	What about "The Notebook (2004)" ?		
USER	I kind of liked that film but I thought the male's role was too weak.		3,3,3
USER	He was acting too needy and being portrayed as a feminine.		3,3,3
USER	Not really		3,3,2
USER	I also like "The Revenant  (2015)" , starring Leonardo Dicaprio.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "@118748?" I thought that was a great movie.		
SYSTEM	Is that the one where he is in the woods?		
USER	No I have not seen it.		2,3,2
USER	Right and he was attacked by a bear. This is film where Leonardo won his first Academy Oscar Award. Finally.		3,3,3

SYSTEM	she wants to help kids by opening a home for kids but...as things would have it in a horror film, something goes wrong		
USER	It sounds interesting.		3,3,5,3
SYSTEM	very atmospheric. creepy. good actually		
SYSTEM	Have you seen an Eli Roth films?		
USER	I like even apocaltptic horror too, like on tv show The Walking Dead.		3,3,4,3

SYSTEM	brad pitt		
USER	No. Never.		3,2,3,2

USER	In south Sibera!		3,4,4,3
SYSTEM	oh I wish there were more Russian films available to see in US

SYSTEM	What kind of movies do you prefer?

SYSTEM	We really liked those, too. Have you seen "Despicable Me (2010)" ? My family really liked those.		
USER	I've watched "Despicable Me (2010)" and to tell you the truth i don't think i actually finished it. I know everybody love minions and think they are cute but for some reason they really annoy me		4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Their language is kind of annoying. Ha! My son really enjoyed "The Lego Batman Movie (2017)" , that may be one you enjoy.

USER	Hi		3,3,3
SYSTEM	How are you? I've seen a few movies lately.		
SYSTEM	The last two were "Amadeus  (1984)" and "The Space Between Us  (2016)"		
USER	I saw "Amadeus  (1984)" it was good. Not sure if I saw the other, it doesn't ring a bell either way.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay. It didn't win awards, was a sci fi romance.		
USER	I was looking more for a film that in addition to the story addressed cross cultural or racial differences.		2,3,3
USER	"Bend It Like Beckham (2002)" from the UK and then "Get Out (2017)" from the US		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Also I liked "The Discovery "		
SYSTEM	Very emotional.		
SYSTEM	Ok.		
SYSTEM	"Around the World in 80 Days  (2004)" fits the story		
SYSTEM	Now i've only read the book.		
SYSTEM	I assume you've seen "To Kill a Mockingbird  (1962)" already		
USER	something contemporary?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	You've seen "American Gangster  (2007)" ?		
USER	no.		2,3,3
SYSTEM	It's based on a true story about a guy who buys &quot;directly from the supplier&quot; going overseas to bring back his &quot;product&quot;		
USER	how is that a film that addresses race?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	That's more cross cultural example.		
SYSTEM	I'm trying to think of a race one.		
USER	well I guess I can try the "Around the World in 80 Days  (2004)" though it sounds pretty light weight and goofy even		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I googled "Race  (2016)"		
SYSTEM	familiar with the story there also only		
SYSTEM	sorry i couldn't do better.		
USER	oh that was a very good movie. that would be a good suggestion for someone who hadnt seen it		4,3,3
USER	ok thanks		3,3,3

USER	Hi		3,3,4
USER	I was thinking about a horror film. Have you seen any good ones lately?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Lights Out  (2016)" was a scary movie with Teresa Palmer which was pretty good		
SYSTEM	If you're looking for more gorey than I watched "The Green Inferno  (2013)" for the first time and that movie is crazy		
USER	I saw that one. It was scary. With the Holidays was thinking something scary. Have you seen "@124172?"		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Or scary gorey movies like "House at the End of the Street (2012)" was crazy as well and pretty grahic sane with "The Last House on the Left  (2009)"		
SYSTEM	I have seen it it was okay		
USER	I saw the "@180482." It was yucky.		3,4,3

SYSTEM	"The Babadook (2014)" gets really incredible reviews but we kinda thought it was just weird.		
SYSTEM	For "Get Out (2017)" telling you anything about the plot would destroy the movie.		
SYSTEM	It's just that weird.		
USER	I love movies that make you think		4,4,3
SYSTEM	But I assure you you won't expect it		
SYSTEM	That one will turn your bring into cottage cheese and send you running for your tin foil hat

SYSTEM	Staying with that genre, have you seen "Juno (2007)" or "The Perks of Being a Wallflower "		
SYSTEM	Those are two really good ones

SYSTEM	"@Misery" is really creepy but really good. I only recently got into horror. Couldn't watch them when I was younger

USER	Yes! "The Princess Bride  (1987)" was one of my favorites too!		3,4,4
SYSTEM	But one of my favorites is "Love and Basketball (2000)"		
SYSTEM	And if I'm going to watch horror, instead of the gore like "Saw  (2004)" I really prefer movies like "Psycho "		
USER	Ok that's an older one right?		3,3,3
USER	I also love lawyer movies like "Philadelphia  (1993)"		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Yea, the year wasn't added on the drop down list it was from 1960 I think		
USER	Ok gotcha.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes, "Philadelphia  (1993)" was so good. Another good one is "Erin Brockovich  (2000)" . I don't think she was a lawyer though, maybe a paralegal. But it was one of my favorites for a while

SYSTEM	I love all his 80's stuff.		
USER	Sweet, it has been years that i have seen those		3,4,4,3,3
USER	me too, they are all classics now		3,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	"Dreamgirls  (2006)" and "Harlem Nights (1989)" are both really good.

USER	nice choices!		3,4,3,4,3
USER	hahaha yeah that was kinda corney		3,3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Suoer corney.		
USER	he was good in "Daddy Day Care (2003)"		3,3,4,3,3

SYSTEM	We have a good list here.		
USER	yeah, i think he reached the point where nothing sparks his intrest		3,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Nothing		
USER	yeah i think so too, thanks so much		3,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Sure, have a great day!		
USER	OVERALL		3,4,4,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello have you seen "Pulp Fiction (1994)" ?		
SYSTEM	I've seen them all. I really enjoy "Reservoir Dogs (1992)" , "Django Unchained (2012)" , "Kill Bill" , and "@164128." Gogo Yubari is hot.		
USER	No		4,3,3
USER	I was looking for a scary movie.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	"The Shining  (1980)"		
USER	I saw that, it was good.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Nice		
SYSTEM	I enjoy that movie		
SYSTEM	"Alien  (1979)" is good too		
USER	Saw that and liked it. Sigourney Weaver was great.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	I know, right?		
USER	I liked "@203424."		4,3,3
SYSTEM	me too		
SYSTEM	Hannibal was a great villian		
USER	and "Red Dragon  (2002)" and "Hannibal  (2001)" -- they were both awesome.		4,3,3
USER	Yes!! Isn't Anthony Hopkins the greatest?		4,4,3
SYSTEM	Haven't seen those last two, though		
SYSTEM	Yeah he's great		
USER	&quot;Can you hear the lambs, Clarice?&quot;		3,3,3
SYSTEM	The part where he feeds a guy his own brain is way more funny than scary, though		
SYSTEM	so goofy		
USER	LOL		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Maybe I'm desensitized by stuff like GTA these days		
USER	I remember that, the guy is sitting at the table with his skullcap off and Hannibal cutting out parts of his brain and throwing it in athe fry pan.		4,3,3
USER	what is GTA?		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Grand Theft Auto; very popular game series		
USER	Oh yes, heard of that.		4,3,3
USER	Didn't a movie come out about that?		4,3,3
SYSTEM	If there is one, then it's only fan-made		
USER	OK. Any other scary movie you can recommend?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Not off the top of my head. "Saving Private Ryan (1998)" can be scary		
SYSTEM	but really it is just emotional		
SYSTEM	most powerful movie I've ever seen		
SYSTEM	I think Ebert said something similar		
USER	I'll have to check that out. I heard Goldie Hawn was in it.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Yeah. Thanks for talking!		
SYSTEM	Goodbye!		
USER	Thank you too. Bye.		3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		4,4,3

SYSTEM	Hi how are you today?		
USER	Hi. I like all sorts of movies but my favorite movie is "Labyrinth  (1986)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	okay can you help me a little and tell me what you liked best about "Labyrinth  (1986)" ?		
USER	I like the fantasy and the music.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	ooops I wrote the wrong one. Hold on, "Labyrinth  (1986)"		
SYSTEM	different spellings!		
SYSTEM	okay so now do they have to be family friendly or can they be darker?		
SYSTEM	I loved "Pan's Labyrinth (2006)"		
USER	Oh I didn't know there was a similar one. Darker movies are fine.		3,4,3,3
USER	Yes I have seen that one. It's a good suggestion though.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	ok and then did you see, it's older a movie called "Time Bandits (1981)"		
SYSTEM	entertaining but not academy award material		
USER	Yes I love the director. I'm so excited for his new movie coming soon.		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	okay so you are a fantasy fan, so you've obviously seen the "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)"		
USER	Haha yes I have. It is very good too.		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	it wasn't a major hit, but I would suggest a movie called "Willow  (1988)"		
SYSTEM	its a ron howard fantasy film		
USER	Sorry, I'm making this difficult. I've seen that too. Maybe I should find another genre.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	not too complex, lots of fantasy elements.		
USER	These are all good suggestions though.		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	noooo! one more before we switch genres....		
SYSTEM	"Kubo and the Two Strings (2016)"		
SYSTEM	it's animation which I normally don't like but this one was special		
USER	Oh, you're so close. I just saw it recently.		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	lol		
SYSTEM	wasn't it great?		
USER	Yes it was good and different.		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	and the soundtrack		
SYSTEM	ok well one last then we change genres. I saw it on netflix or maybe amazon it was called "MirrorMask (2005)"		
USER	I saw that in the theater! I love Neil Gaiman too.		3,4,3,3
USER	What's your favorite movie of a different type?		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I didn't think I'd like it. but it was a good plot without getting too complex.		
SYSTEM	I like good movies. not genre specific but sci fi and fantasy are not my first go tos. Like drama.		
SYSTEM	horror		
SYSTEM	foreign		
USER	I don't like a lot of horror with gore. Scary is ok with less blood.		3,5,3,3
USER	Oh let's try foreign. I've seen more French movies than others. I like "Amélie (2001)" .		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	most horror now is bloody.		
USER	And I like "The Double Life of Veronique (1991)" .		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	did you see French version of "War of the Buttons  (2011)" ?		
USER	I have not!		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	oh it's good.		
SYSTEM	takes place during WWII and follows kids and adults.		
USER	I will try to check it out.		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	also, I think you'd like this, it's called "Korkoro" and involves a gypsy clan in France trying to escape being imprisoned by the Nazis		
USER	Ok thank you. I don't know that one either.		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	sad, magical, real, very good		
SYSTEM	very French		
SYSTEM	ok, well sorry I couldn't help you with fantasy but glad I could help with foreign!		
USER	Yes, thank you!		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	you were fun to talk with!		
SYSTEM	have a nice rest of the day!

SYSTEM	Something like "The Thin Red Line  (1998)" ?		
USER	Yeah that might work. I just need real directors and real story...not just navy seals being filmed lol		3,3,2
SYSTEM	"Saving Private Ryan (1998)" is good.		
USER	that whole benghazi thing was so dumb....		3,3,3
SYSTEM	You're hilarious. You could always watch the ultimate "Apocalypse Now (1979)" .

USER	I haven't seen that. I would like to though. I enjoyed "The Incredibles (2004)" , the first one.		3,3,3,2
USER	That's a good idea.		4,4,3,3
USER	My family liked it too.		3,3,2,3

SYSTEM	Or there's a new thriller out "A Quiet Place (2018)"		
USER	I also watched "Black Panther (2018)" It was really enjoyable. Cool Super Hero		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Ocean's 8 (2018)" is another one.		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Deadpool 2  (2018)" ?		
USER	I haven't seen that does it have to do with the "Ocean's Eleven (2001)"		3,2,3,3

USER	Hi!		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hi how may I help you with movies?		
USER	Do you know of any good vampire movies?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	oh yeah.		
SYSTEM	Do they have to be current?		
USER	Not really.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	There are a few from the 80's which helped move vampires into the realm of cool.		
SYSTEM	Not to be confused with the "The Hunger Games  (2012)"		
SYSTEM	there was "The Hunger  (1983)"		
SYSTEM	David Bowie and Catherine Deneuve		
USER	That sounds familiar.		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	susan sarandon was in it too		
USER	I saw one from the 90s call "Mom " recently.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	also in the 80's for a slightly younger set but still super entertaining was "The Lost Boys (1987)"		
USER	I've seen "The Lost Boys (1987)" when I was younger.		3,4,3,3
USER	It's not too bad.		2,2,2,3
SYSTEM	it's from the 80s so it's got that vibe to it		
USER	Yeah it does.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	are you talking about "Mom's Got a Date with a Vampire" ?		
SYSTEM	that's what you saw?		
USER	No, it was just called "Mom " . Some guy's old mother gets bit by a vampire and he has a hard time dealing with it.		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	never heard of it. was it a comedy?		
USER	I think so, but it wasn't too funny to me. More like a thriller or something.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	ok well one of the best modern vampire films I've seen is called "Let Me In  (2010)"		
SYSTEM	it's about a bullied kid who makes friends with an odd new girl in his neighborhood.		
USER	I've heard of that one. I should check it out. Seems like the older movies are better.		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	this one is really good.		
USER	Alright. Thanks for the suggestions.		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	hope you enjoy them!		
USER	Ciao!		3,4,3,3

SYSTEM	Have you seen "Jigsaw (2017)" ? its a continuation of the "Saw  (2004)" movies.		
USER	I have been hearing that name a lot in the last few minutes.....		3,3,2

USER	I will definitely watch that one.		3,4,4
SYSTEM	one that i'm waiting to see that comes out in april is called "Truth or Dare  (2013)" with Lucy Hale. The commercial really caught my attention. I guess if you tell a Lie instead of the truth, you die.		
USER	Scary stuff. WIll Smith has a new one coming out too, have you heard? It's being filmed in Savannahj.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	No i haven't! I love his work. "Independence Day  (1996)" is my all time favorite of his

SYSTEM	OH a favorite of mine is "Zombieland (2009)"		
USER	That is a good one. I laughed through the whole thing.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Me too!! I just couldn't do the zombie clown at the end.. too scary for me. lol		
USER	Do you have any suggestions like that?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Another adventure comedy is "Kick-Ass  (2010)" it just couldn't hold my attention unfortunately		
SYSTEM	it may be different for you		
USER	I saw the trailer for that one and it didn't really seem like my thing.		2,3,3
USER	I loved "21 Jump Street  (2012)" though. That one cracked me up.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Did you see "22 Jump Street (2014)" ?? JUST AS GOOD		
USER	I didn't know they made a second one. I'll have to check it out. Thanks.		3,3,3

USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hey		
USER	Hello!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	What was the last movie you saw in the theater?		
USER	The latest Insidious by Blum House Productions. Was a real disappointment.		3,3,3
USER	Since nearly all their horror movies are good, most of the Insidious ones anyway.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	So you like horror flicks?		
USER	That's one of the genres I like, yes.		3,3,4
USER	"Insidious: The Last Key (2018)" was kind of boring and fast paced I feel like. Not much happened in the movie. I had expected more.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Jigsaw (2017)" ?		
USER	I have no seen the newest Jigsaw, actually. Been meaning to.		3,3,3
USER	I am kind of waiting for my husband to come home for transit leave so we can watch it together. But then we might not have time since we're moving to Hawaii soon after he comes back home.		3,3,3
USER	We only have about a week to get ready.		3,3,3
USER	Have you seen "Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Probably out on video now...isn't it a continuation of the "Saw  (2004)"		
SYSTEM	I have seen it. Better than "Kingsman: The Golden Circle" for sure.		
USER	Yeah, still would like to wait to watch it with my husband. We usually stream it anyways. I believe it is.		3,3,3
USER	"Kingsman: The Golden Circle" in my opinion was good, but certainly not better than the previous.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Anything besides horror flicks?		
USER	I do like action, fantasy, mystery, comedy as well.		3,3,3
USER	Oh, right! I have yet to see the new "The Maze Runner  (2014)" ..		3,3,3
USER	I forgot what it was called.		3,3,3
USER	"Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018)" !		3,3,3
SYSTEM	If you like spy movies "Spectre  (2015)" would be a good choice.		
USER	I love Dylan O Brien, honestly.		3,3,4
USER	Oh, so James Bond eh?		3,3,3
USER	I would be interested in seeing that. I just may watch it tonight.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I don't like the "Maze Runner: The Death Cure (2018)" series because I think they advertise towards kids. Yes, James Bond.		
USER	I don't think it's towards kids, per say. Perhaps younger audience, sure.		3,3,4
USER	I'm 22, young adult so it's perfect.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	"Justice League  (2017)" is the movie of the year for me.		
SYSTEM	If you like action, it is worth seeing twice.		
SYSTEM	Have a good night.		
SYSTEM	Goodbye		
USER	OVERALL		3,2,3

SYSTEM	Hello, I would love to recommend some good movies for you today.		
SYSTEM	Did you have anything special in mind?		
USER	Hi! I'm looking for dog movies. Anything from "Cujo  (1983)" to "@122154."		3,4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I loved "@109453."		
SYSTEM	I have not seen "@122154." Maybe I would give it a try.		
SYSTEM	Let me brainstorm a bit.		
USER	It's a real tear-jerker, especially if you have dogs.		3,4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	What about "A Dog's Purpose  (2017)"		
SYSTEM	Sadly I never had dogs because I grew up in an apartment.		
USER	Is that the controversial one? Where there was video proof of them throwing a dog into water on scene?		3,4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I haven't seen it myself, but my friend loves it. She says it focuses on what goes into the mind of a dog. How they can be human like.		
SYSTEM	There's no violence, it's more heart warming in nature.		
SYSTEM	If you like something funnier, what about "Air Bud: World Pup (2000)"		
USER	I meant in the filming of the movie. Someone leaked footage of them throwing a dog into water and it being terrified! It was sad and caused a big stir. A lot of people boycotted the movie.		3,3,2,2,3
SYSTEM	It's great, especially if you like soccer.		
USER	My daughter would love Air Bud. Great suggestion.		3,4,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Oh, that really sad, I was not aware of that.		
SYSTEM	I seen that. It's fun.		
USER	I appreciate your help!		4,4,4,4,5
SYSTEM	Would you like another recommendation?		
USER	Off to watch Air Bud!		3,3,3,4,3

SYSTEM	Its about a life threatening disease and how it started

SYSTEM	No its more realistic, like an outbreak		
USER	Oh. Maybe not something quite that dark.		3,3,3,3
USER	A movie that's a bit more positive might be good.		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	"Anth (1994)"

USER	Can you tell me a bit about that movie?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Its about a couple having money troubles, and a stranger shows up at they're house with an offer to help them financially, but someone would have to die

USER	The best film "Halloween  (1978)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yup the ones that followed were pale imitiations

SYSTEM	Comedies are great!		
SYSTEM	Do you like romantic comedies?		
USER	depends, most of the time no....		3,3,3
SYSTEM	What does it depend on?		
USER	who's in it and how sappy it gets		3,3,3
USER	would "The Hangover (2009)" count as a romcom?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I watched one recently. In my opinion it wasn't to sappy. It was sad a little but in a more realistic way.		
USER	it involved a marriage		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I'm not sure. I would have to look it up.		
USER	I was upset when Allen Arkin died in "Little Miss Sunshine (2006)"		3,3,3
USER	what did you see recently?		3,4,3
SYSTEM	That did stink.		
SYSTEM	It was called "@78779." It's a Scottish comedy which is a turnoff for some people but it's one of my favorites.		
USER	Can you understand it w/out subs?		3,3,3
USER	Love up films usually.		3,3,4
USER	UK		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Yes, but I did not find it as good as the animated original.		
SYSTEM	There is also "Tangled (2010)" which is about Rapunzel, of course.

USER	I love horror movies I am always looking for more because I feel like I have seen them all!		5,3,3,3
USER	And I am doing well thanks!		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hmmm... have you seen "It  (2017)" and "Get Out (2017)" ? Those are both awesome.		
SYSTEM	Or "Psycho  (1960)" , which is one of my personal favorites.		
USER	some of my favorite horror movies are "Mama  (2013)" "It  (2017)"		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Happy Death Day  (2017)" looked good, too.		
USER	I have not seen "Psycho  (1960)" what is that about?		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Ooh, that's like the original horror film!		
USER	Also I have seen trailers for "Happy Death Day  (2017)" but I wasnt sure if it would be worth it, it looked poor quality.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	It's an Alfred Hitchcock film about some very strange goings on at the Bates Motel, including an owner who's a devoted mama's boy.		
SYSTEM	It's a great movie.		
SYSTEM	"The Woman in Black  (2012)" is pretty scary too.		
USER	I'll have to look into that one it seems interesting!		5,3,3,3
USER	I love the "The Woman in Black  (2012)" ~ so good		5,3,3,3
USER	I like mainly paranormal movies though they are really interesting to me		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah, I agree. They scare me more haha. "The Conjuring (2013)" was pretty good too.		
USER	such as "Paranormal Activity (2007)" and "Insidious  (2011)"		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I had to watch "Insidious  (2011)" for a class in college and the whole classroom was screaming at certain parts... it was hilarious. "Paranormal Activity (2007)" really freaked me out.		
USER	Really? I wish I had a college class that would allow us to watch scary movies! Also "Paranormal Activity (2007)" is very scary I agree, at first I heard it was bad but after watching all of them it is crazy and scary how all of them connect		5,3,3,3
USER	There is also another movie coming out soon related to the conjuring about the nun in it I am so excited!		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Yeah it's insane!		
SYSTEM	Oh really? That's crazy!		
SYSTEM	The Warrens are actually real, I know someone who knows the priest who blesses their &quot;artifacts&quot; room		
USER	Wait really? that is actually so cool!		4,4,4,3
USER	I have always wanted to visit their museum but am scared to be cursed or something		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah, I think Lorraine is still alive? And ahh I know it's so creepy to think about		
USER	I also really love family movies like "Moana  (2016)"		3,3,4,3
USER	and the "The Croods (2013)"		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Me too. "Moana  (2016)" and "Tangled (2010)" are my favorites.		
USER	Oh yeah I love "Tangled (2010)" such a great take on Rupenzel sorry dont know how to spell her name		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	I know its so great. I love how gutsy and spunky she is!		
USER	Do you have any other good family movies to recommend?		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "@122604?"		
USER	No I havent, what is that about? I havent even heard of it!		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Ok so it looks and soudns weird, but it's actually really good. It's about a boy who wants to learn more about his family and ancestors and travels to the land of the dead to interact with them. It's surprisingly touching and lovely. Also a tear jerker.		
SYSTEM	I've also heard really good things about "Ferdinand (2017)" , but I haven't seen it yet		
USER	That actually sounds great I'll have to write that down, seems like my kind of movie!		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	It is SO good. I was really surprised by it.		
USER	Well anyways thanks for the chat, some really great suggestions and I am definately going to watch "Coco  (2017)" Thanks so much for the chat! Always love hearing about new movies!		3,3,4,3

SYSTEM	Hey hope you are having a great day		
SYSTEM	what kind of movies do u like		
USER	Hi there, I am well! Hope you are as well. I really enjoy horror films. I saw "Insidious: Chapter 4 (2018)" this past weekend.		5,3,3
SYSTEM	My sister wanted to see that. Have you seen "@77161?" that's one of my favorite horror movies		
SYSTEM	Another one i like is "Scary Movie (2000)" even though it's more of a comedy than a horror movie		
USER	It was pretty good, I was surprised. I have not seen "A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)" , I have heard nothing but great things about it. I love "Scary Movie (2000)" ,but my favorite from that franchise is definitely "Scary Movie 2 (2001)" ! It was hilarious.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "@115463?" I loved that movie because it was unexpected.		
USER	It was good, a bit gruesome! All of the "Saw  (2003)" movies were pretty gory it seems.		4,3,3
USER	One of my favorite modern horror movies is "Strangers  (2007)" ,though. It was a perfect mesh of gore and suspense.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	My sister really likes "@185171." You should see that too!		
SYSTEM	"Strangers  (2007)" was awesome!		
USER	"The Conjuring (2013)" was pretty scary! I enjoyed it. I am so glad they are making a sequel to "Strangers  (2007)" ! That movie made me afraid of old songs haha.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	It was good chatting with you have a good day		
USER	OVERALL		4,3,3

USER	Hey There! How are you? I am looking for scary movies.		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	so the most recent scary movie i've seen is "Happy Death Day  (2017)" . I thought it was really good. Its about a girl who dies but keeps reliving her death until her murder is solved		
USER	I loved that one! Never thought it would have been her roommate the whole time		4,3,3,3
USER	I really like scary movies like "Ouija  (2014)" have you seen that one?		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	OMG YES. and now i'm afraid of Ouija boards...		
USER	same! It scary and people say they are really bad not just cause of the movie but i dont want to find out.		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	You didn't see the new "It  (2017)" did you? Don't. The original is way better		
USER	i watched some of but i really didnt think he was as good was the old so i never finished it		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	They are great!		
SYSTEM	If you don't mind older scary movies. "Cube  (1997)" holds up today.

SYSTEM	Please tell me a bit about your taste in movies		
USER	Hi! I just watched "Jurassic Park  (1993)" over the weekend and now in the mood for another great dinosaur movie!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Well I think "The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)" might be a good one, to continue on the enjoyment of the original.		
SYSTEM	What are some other movies you enjoy typically?		
USER	Well I did enjoy the special effects in that movie I just found it a bit long and underwhelming. It just didn't capture the same feeling as the first.		5,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen the movie "Dinosaur  (2000)" ?		
USER	I tend to like those type of monster movies. I loved "@112622." I found "Godzilla  (2014)" to be pretty entertaining as well.		4,4,3
USER	Yes that was a very cute movie! I loved "The Land Before Time (1988)" time when I was little.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	How about "Gremlins (1984)" . Now there's a creepy series of films.		
SYSTEM	These used to scare the crap out of me when I was a kid!		
USER	Oh yeah! I absolutely loved that movie when I was a kid!!! "Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990)" was even better because of all the fun technology in Clamp's tower.		4,3,3

USER	I knowwwww, I am a horrible horror fan		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I liked them okay. Through I think the story was pieced together as they went along		
USER	I think I started the first and it was ok and then I got overwhelmed at the rate they were releasing new ones		3,3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I think that's what happened to a lot of people. Myself included. I liked them, but the story didn't require 7 movies to complete. Even "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)" concluded in 3 films		
USER	I haven't seen any of those either lol		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	*faints*

USER	???		3,3,3,1,3
SYSTEM	"@125280," "@120854," "@91313," and "Happy Gilmore (1996)" I liked.

SYSTEM	Yes, not very realistic		
USER	I love Jim Carey in "Liar Liar (1997)" too		3,3,3,4,4
SYSTEM	It reminds me of "Groundhog Day  (1993)" .		
USER	How?		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I don't think I saw "Liar Liar (1997)" .		
USER	it was another good one		3,4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	The one where the day repeats over and over?		
SYSTEM	Part of his philosophy before that was to meet people based on an algorithm		
USER	"Yes Man  (2008)" never repeated the days though		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Yes, but his decision to meet someone was based on an unusual philosophy		
USER	ok...anyways, what is your fav movie?		3,3,3,1,3
SYSTEM	I like "@99896." But part of that is that I enjoyed the movie in the theater		
SYSTEM	The swinging was pretty cool on screen.

SYSTEM	"The Truman Show (1998)" I saw in theater too.		
SYSTEM	The town they filmed it in is not too far.

SYSTEM	Hi! What genre of movies are you interested in?		
USER	We gotta hurry the movie starts soon!		3,4,3,3
USER	I like horror		3,4,3,3
USER	"Friday the 13th  (1980)"		3,5,3,3
USER	yes?		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "It  (2017)" ?		
USER	No, it looked pervers! :D		3,4,3,3
USER	"Scream  (1996)" SCARY :DO		3,4,3,3
USER	owah...		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	What about "Jeepers Creepers  (2001)" ?		
USER	Did you see "Too Late"		3,3,2,3
USER	sounds good by!		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	"It (1990)" is good too		
SYSTEM	Also, you have to see "Scream 4 (2011)"		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,2,3

SYSTEM	Hi there! What kind of movie can I help you find today?		
USER	I would like horror film recommendation, I saw "The Wailing  (2016)" and "The Babadook (2014)" and really liked them		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Great choices have you seen any of the "Annabelle  (2014)" movies?		
USER	No, never heard of them		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "The Blackcoat's Daughter (2015)" that one was pretty spooky!		
SYSTEM	Oh! Annebelle and the sequel are about a haunted doll, its also based on a true story		
USER	No but I am interested in both films		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	"Lights Out  (2016)" is also a good scary flick		
USER	I don't think a horror true story exists		3,3,1,3
SYSTEM	Oh it definely does exsist.		
USER	especially if there are haunted dolls in it		3,3,2,2
SYSTEM	There is a real version of Annebelle the doll in a haunted museum in Las Vegas nevada		
USER	So "Annabelle  (2014)" is so good that it will make me believe in haunted dolls ?		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	You dont necessarily have to believe in haunted dolls to watch the movie, but it is a real story that will make you think twice if it is possible to happen.		
SYSTEM	If you google Annebelle you can read about the real doll. Its a pretty crazy movie.		
SYSTEM	Any other suggestions I can help with today?		
USER	You sold me to it, I will try to watch it		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Watch them both! Itll scare the life out of you!		
USER	No you have been very helpful		4,4,3,4
USER	Thanks		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Fantastic! Happy Horror Movie watching!

SYSTEM	how about "The Notebook (2004)"		
SYSTEM	that always gives me a good cry		
USER	I've seen that one already. I like it, but I'd like to see something new.		3,3,3
USER	I've also seen "Titanic  (1997)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	yes "Titanic  (1997)" was a great movie		
USER	I like old movies too. i really liked "@137195." So an older movie may be nice		3,4,3
SYSTEM	yeah i really liked "Patch Adams  (1998)"		
SYSTEM	not only my favorite movie but also my favorite actor is in it aswell.		
USER	Ok, is it sad? Will I get my good cry?		4,4,4

SYSTEM	Sounds good, have you seen "Up  (2009)" ?		
USER	Yes, that was a good movie. You?		3,3,4

USER	Sad [movie]		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Are you talking about "Sad Movie (2005)" ?

SYSTEM	Okay, my apologies, I understand. And yes, it was a sad movie, but I enjoyed it.		
SYSTEM	I want to see "Peter Rabbit (2018)"		
USER	Oh yes. I saw that in the theatre. Good movie!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	The other night, I saw "The Golden Compass  (2007)" which was great, but I recommend reading the books first ;)		
USER	I haven't read a book in years		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I haven't either. My boyfriend read the series, but I have not. It is still a good movie having not read the books, but I'm sure it would be better if I had.		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Jumanji  (2017)" the new one?		
USER	No, I'm really really tired of remakes and everything.. the corresponding spiderman movie siereis really killed my desire to follow along anymore.. I like the Toby guy in the "Spider-Man  (2002)"		3,3,2
SYSTEM	I can relate. I haven't seen the new "Jumanji  (2017)" and I definitely agree about the spider man series		
USER	Sigh.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	But I've got to go for now. One last recommendation, is "Hugo  (2011)"

SYSTEM	"Gone Girl  (2014)" is an interesting movie		
USER	I did not like that either. the book was so much better.		5,3,3
SYSTEM	I watched "The Prestige  (2006)" again recently, I still like that movie.		
USER	but decent film if you did not read the book first.		4,3,3
USER	Prestie is amazing		4,3,4
USER	I love that film		3,3,4
USER	always go to rewatch that one		4,3,4
SYSTEM	the late 1800s/early 1900 is great.

SYSTEM	Maybe you would like "The Time Machine  (2002)" with guy richie		
USER	loved the machinist as well		3,3,4

SYSTEM	Hi, what kind of movies do you like?		
USER	Hi! I'm looking for a sad movie. I had a really bad day and am hoping to be cheered up by seeing someone worse off than me.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	How about "Dear John  (2010)" or "Message in a Bottle  (1999)"		
USER	Hmm I haven't seen either of them. They both look like they have potential.		3,2,2,3
USER	I've liked "Old Yeller  (1957)" and "The Champ  (1979)" in the past.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Another sad one would be "@194977."		
SYSTEM	YEs they are both sad movies.		
USER	Yes that one seems good as well.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I hate to see a dog die or any animal.		
USER	I think I'll check it out.		3,3,2,3

SYSTEM	have you seen "Earth to Echo (2014)" ?		
USER	No, what's that one about?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	it's animated, but it's about an alien robot		
USER	I'll have to check it out		3,3,4
SYSTEM	the "The BFG  (2016)" is also good		
USER	I read that book when I was a kid. I've been reluctant to see the film in case they messed it up.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	oh yeah I can understand that		
USER	Was it any good?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I liked it, but I didn't read the book		
SYSTEM	did you see "A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)"		
USER	Well, I guess I'll have to give it a chance eventually. "A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001)" was so sad but Stanley Kubrick always liked those kinds of ending. Not bad for a swan song film thugh		3,3,4
USER	*though		3,3,4
SYSTEM	yeah I know it was sad, good movie though		
SYSTEM	well hope i helped you today

USER	I am doing well. Looking for a nice family movie		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	My favorite old family movie is "Galaxy Quest (1999)"

USER	That's too cute ;)		3,3,3,4,4
USER	That was a great film, along with "It (1990)"		3,4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah - I was like heck no there are images now burned into my brain I can never forget.		
USER	Those are the best horror movies, I suppose ;)		3,3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	I am hearing great things about "Black Panther (2018)" too. Everyone is going nuts about it.		
USER	Yeah, "Black Panther (2018)" has shown up in my newsfeed countless times on Facebook. I'll definitely look into that as well!		3,3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Maybe ESPECIALLY my son. but - this is my weekend - we are going to see "A Wrinkle in Time " dang it

SYSTEM	Hello		
SYSTEM	What sort of movies are you looking to find?		
USER	Hi. Can you help me find a good comedy movie?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Absolutely.		
SYSTEM	If you like older flicks, you could check out "Ghostbusters (1984)" or "Groundhog Day  (1993)"		
USER	One of my favorites is "@173785."		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Some good newer ones would be "Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (2010)" and "The Big Sick (2017)"		
USER	I really liked the first two movies you suggested. I have not seen "Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (2010)" or "The Big Sick (2017)" what are they about?		4,4,4,3
SYSTEM	"Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (2010)" is about two rednecks who get caught in some wild antics in the woods.		
SYSTEM	The other one is about a guy whose girlfriend becomes ill and their struggles.		
SYSTEM	Of the two, I would say "Tucker & Dale vs. Evil (2010)" is the better choice		
USER	I think I will watch "@194556." Thanks for the help.		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yep, enjoy!		
SYSTEM	Have a good night		
USER	I do not think I will like the other movie.		3,2,3,3

SYSTEM	Perhaps "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 (2015)"

SYSTEM	Yes it is.		
SYSTEM	"The Italian Job  (2003)" had a strong female character		
USER	I heard good things about it but it's really too bad Hollywood isn't making more films about real women		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Kill Bill: Volume 2 (2004)" was as strong as you can get		
USER	I saw the "The Italian Job  (2003)" it was a good movie but not something I'd show young women as an inspirational goal		3,3,3
USER	yeah, those are good strong fantasy women, not real ones. I'll check out "Atomic Blonde (2017)" just for fun.		3,3,3

SYSTEM	That movie is really sad.		
USER	I haen't seen that one.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	That would be very unhappy.		
USER	yeah it made me cry		3,4,3
SYSTEM	It is about a guy that comes back from war and pretends he is a lady's husband.		
SYSTEM	He dies in the end, trying to protect the family.		
USER	Oh wow		4,4,3
USER	Sort of reminds me of "Changeling  (2008)"		3,4,4
SYSTEM	I never seen that.		
USER	Well it's about the police returning a kid to his family except it's the wrong kid. But everyone thinks the mother is lying.		3,4,3

SYSTEM	Hi there! How can I help you find some movies?		
USER	Hi I'm looking for some non Disney animated movies.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Sure thing! What's one in particular that you like?		
USER	I enjoyed "@85417."		4,3,3
SYSTEM	It's funny because "Anastasia  (1997)" is commonly thought of as a Disney movie, but it's not		
USER	Oh yes, "Anastasia  (1997)" is a good film, and now that I think of it "The Brave Little Toaster (1987)" is technically Disney too. Do you know anymore like "@177110?"		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Well it's not similar to "Anastasia  (1997)" exactly, but I enjoyed "Spirited Away"		
USER	"Spirited Away" is a great film.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Also "The Prince of Egypt (1998)" is very underrated		
USER	I haven't seen "@190246." I'll have to check it out, thank you.		4,4,4
SYSTEM	Also recently, check out "Ferdinand (2017)" I guess nowadays animated movies are usually 3D based		
SYSTEM	It's about a bull who escapes captivity from a matador		
USER	That sounds really interesting actually. Like an underdog story.		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Yep that's basically it		
SYSTEM	Actually the funny thing is that John Cena voices the bull		
USER	That sounds hilarious!		4,4,4
USER	Thank you for all the great suggestions. :)		4,4,3

SYSTEM	I'm doing well.		
USER	Yes, I'm looking for some good horror movies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Watch the original "Hostel  (2005)" film		
USER	I really liked "Mother! (2017)"		4,3,3

SYSTEM	any scream film is good		
SYSTEM	You could watch the first "Saw  (2004)" film as well

USER	OVERALL		4,3,3

SYSTEM	Are you looking for a specific genre movie?

USER	already released recently		3,2,2
SYSTEM	Have you watched the new "@83552?" It features Jack Black, Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson, and Kevin Hart.

USER	any new crime movies?		3,3,2
SYSTEM	"Father Figures (2017)" is a new comedy		
USER	or kids movies		3,4,3
SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" could be considered a crime movie, but also a thriller		
USER	Getout was horrible		2,4,2
SYSTEM	"Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes (2018)" is a new kids movie that looks great!

SYSTEM	Hi! Is there a specific type of movie you're looking for?

USER	Me too. Also liked "Monsters University (2013)"		4,3,3,3
USER	Good suggestion		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Thanks! I was surprised the sequel was so good!		
SYSTEM	Sequels are usually disappointing		
USER	Agreed, that is not usually the case		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Toy Story 3 (2010)" ?		
SYSTEM	That one really tug at the heart strings		
USER	Yes but it was not my favorite. That's an example where the sequels are not as good as the original		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I agree. Nothing beats "Toy Story (1995)"		
USER	True.		3,3,3,3
USER	Good recommendations we like similar shows.		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I am also a fan of "Up  (2009)"

SYSTEM	Oh, great! I love them. Have you seen "The Conjuring (2013)"		
USER	i love that movie!		4,4,4,4,3
SYSTEM	Cool. And if you don't mind some gore, "The Evil Dead (1981)" and "Evil Dead  (2013)" the remake are great!		
SYSTEM	Very creepy scary and weird.		
USER	those are good ones as well. I also loved "Ouija  (2014)"		3,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes, Also scary. And "Sinister  (2012)" is very frightening. The remake, "Sinister 2 (2015)" was bad, though.		
USER	i havent seen those. are they good?		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes, but just the original. The first one. The sequel, "@167031," sucked.		
USER	what are they about		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	About a demon who comes to people through films they make. Very creepy in the execution.		
SYSTEM	Do you like older movies, too?		
USER	that sounds scary but pretty good. i do		4,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Things like "The Exorcist  (1973)" or "The Shining  (1980)"		
USER	i like both of those!		3,3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	Great! Me, too. Also recommend the original "A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)"		
SYSTEM	That movie scared the stuffing out of me.		
USER	i like that one too. the new one is different for sure though. Thanks for talking to me, have a great night!		4,4,4,2,4

SYSTEM	I liked the Older "It (1990)" Though more		
USER	yes i loved "It  (2017)"		3,3,3
USER	the orginal is better		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Annabelle  (2014)"		
USER	i saw that along with "Happy Death Day  (2017)"		3,3,3
USER	"Annabelle  (2014)" was good. that doll is creepy though		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hi!		
SYSTEM	I love movies!		
SYSTEM	What kind of movies do you like?		
USER	Hi		3,4,3,3,3
USER	How are you?		3,4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I'm great!		
USER	I love superhero movies		4,4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	How are you?		
SYSTEM	Okay.		
SYSTEM	I love superhero movies as well.		
USER	i'm doing good, thanks for asking		4,4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	I would recommend "Superman  (1978)" It's a classic super hero movie!		
USER	I recently watched "Black Panther (2018)" and i really loved it! i think it was a great movie. A little boring in the beginning but in general it was agood movie		4,4,3,3,3
USER	I've watched it but honestly i'm not into "Superman  (1978)" or "Batman  (1989)"		3,2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I thought "Black Panther (2018)" was a horrible movie full of divisiveness.		
USER	I'm more into "Thor " and "The Avengers  (2012)"		3,3,3,3,4
USER	really? i thought it was pretty good		3,3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Those were both horrible films as well.		
SYSTEM	I didn't like them.		
SYSTEM	I would recommend a real super hero movie such as "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)" with Gene Wilder.		
USER	I don't even consider "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)" a superhero movie		3,2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	You're telling me that Willy Wonka isn't a super hero? He has oompa loompas which are a mythical creature working for him to make his candy.		
SYSTEM	So you're saying that you agree that Willy Wonka actually exists in real life?		
USER	No he doesn't but that doesn't mean he is a superhero		2,2,2,3,3
SYSTEM	I consider anyone who makes an everlasting gobstopper a superhero.		
SYSTEM	We'll have to agree to disagree.		
USER	I love that movie though		4,4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Capitulation.		
SYSTEM	Well, enjoy my movie recommendations.

SYSTEM	"Pulp Fiction (1994)" if you're into Tarantino's work.		
USER	"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994)" was amazing at the time as well		4,4,3,3

SYSTEM	Hi. How are you?		
USER	Hell, I'm looking for some action films like "@144347," "@181776," and "@182157." I really liked this movie series.		3,3,3,3
USER	Oops, I meant hello, sorry for the type error.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Those are good one. Have you seen "Alien  (1979)" it's older but it's a really good one.		
USER	I have seen "Alien  (1979)" and did like the movie.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Another classic is "Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977)"		
SYSTEM	But if you'd like something newer I can find you something		
USER	No, I did not watch that, and mostly likely won't.		3,3,3,2
USER	Something newer please.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh okay. Let me find you a couple of new ones		
SYSTEM	a 2015 movie called "The Transporter Refueled (2015)" is really good and I've heard it was really good.		
USER	Ok, that sounds good, I'll check this out.		3,3,4,4
SYSTEM	Okay great. I'm glad I could help you. Goodbye		
USER	Good bye.		3,4,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3,3

USER	hello!		3,3,3
USER	I'm looking for a horror movie, preferably without jumpscares		3,3,3
SYSTEM	good day		
SYSTEM	I would recommend "Jumper  (2008)"		
USER	"Jumper  (2008)" ? That's not a horror movie lol		2,3,2
SYSTEM	it was a little scary		
SYSTEM	How about "Jeepers Creepers  (2001)"		
USER	I was thinking more along the lines of "The Sixth Sense (1999)" or "The Shining  (1980)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	that movie was weird		
USER	I liked that one, it was good and creepy!		4,3,3
USER	did you ever see "Jeepers Creepers 2 (2003)" ? That was pretty good too!		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Maybe "127 Hours (2010)" that scared me		
SYSTEM	I hear they are working on a Jeepers remake		
USER	I haven't seen that one yet. I know what it's about, I don't know if I could stomach &quot;that scene.&quot;		3,3,3
USER	Even the Saw movies are too nasty for me and those *aren't* based on a real story		3,3,3
SYSTEM	maybe they are		
SYSTEM	There's always "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  (2003)"		
USER	I haven't seen the remake yet, that's a good idea. "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)" was very good back in the day. Sort of brought the slasher fic to a broader audience, like "Halloween  (1978)"		3,3,3
USER	I guess I'll check that movie out. Nice chatting with you, have a great day		4,3,3
USER	OVERALL		4,3,3

SYSTEM	HI!		
SYSTEM	What kind of movies are you looking for?		
USER	I'm looking for action or comedy movies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I highly recommend "The Greatest Showman (2017)" no matter what you like. It was really good.		
SYSTEM	Did you see "Jumanji  (2017)" I heard it's funny. I saw the first one "Jumanji (1995)" and it was good.		
USER	I also liked "Jumanji (1995)" , but haven't seen the new one.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I've heard "Pitch Perfect 3 (2017)" was good too but I haven't seen it yet. "Pitch Perfect (2012)" and "Pitch Perfect 2 (2015)" were good ones.		
USER	I don't really like musicals very much. The only one I like is "Grease  (1978)"		3,3,2
SYSTEM	"Blended  (2014)" was a cute one too.		
USER	I like action movies. The last one I saw in theater was "@170305."		3,4,3
SYSTEM	I don't like musicals either on the screen only on stage. But this one blew me away. I was mad for a second when I was sitting there at the beginning and found out it was a musical		
SYSTEM	i have not seen that one but heard it was good.		
USER	I'll have to look into it.		3,4,3
USER	I did see "Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014)" also. It was pretty good even though I am not a huge super hero fan.		3,3,3

SYSTEM	"You've Got Mail (1998)"

USER	No, I haven't. I'll check that one out. Thanks.		4,4,3

USER	Hi, I'm looking for some movie suggestions, you think you could help me?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	What types of movies do you like?

SYSTEM	"A Walk to Remember (2002)" was a great movie but really sad		
USER	I love Jennifer Lawrence so I really do love that movie. Mandy moore was great in "A Walk to Remember (2002)" that is another classic.		4,3,3

SYSTEM	Oh yes! my favorite!		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Crank: High Voltage (2009)" or "Baby Driver  (2017)"		
USER	I haven't seen any of them.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	They are great. My favorite one is an old one "Good Will Hunting (1997)" great one		
USER	I've seen parts of that film. Matt Damon did a well job.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes he did		
USER	I liked "Lion  (2016)" with Nicole Kidman and it's about that Indian boy whom was lost on a train and later was adopted to an Australian couples.		3,3,3
USER	He later found his old village on Google Map and reunited with his mother and family. Very sad!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I haven't seen that! But I want to.....I must check it out!		
USER	Make sure you don't cry too much especially at the end.		3,3,3
USER	The main actor was great in this film.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Remember Me  (2010)" it's amazing. I cry at everything!!		
SYSTEM	You really have me wanting to watch it now!		
USER	It sounds familiar but doesn't ring a bell. What is it about?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Remember Me  (2010)" has Robert Pattinson in it and it's a story about his relationship which is broken with his dad...so good		
USER	Rent it on Amazon live steam it.		3,3,3
USER	Oh I probably haven't seen it then.		3,3,3
USER	Do you have any more suggestions?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Taken  (2008)" it has 3 movies and very good!		
USER	I've seen it and it was great. Loved Neeson.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	or "Wonder  (2017)" made me cry!		
USER	I haven't seen it yet.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh that one is a must see!		
SYSTEM	Another one is "Revolutionary Road  (2008)"		
USER	I will probably check it later today.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Good!		
USER	What is that about? I never heard of it.		3,3,3
USER	War?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Has Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet trying to raise their kids back in the 50's it's very good

USER	Hey!		3,3,3,3
USER	Want to help me find a good romantic comedy?		3,3,3,3
USER	Like "This Is 40 (2012)" but not like "P.S. I Love You  (2007)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hmm, I've never seen the second one. What about something like "The Proposal  (2009)" ?		
USER	I think I saw that. With Sandra BUllock and Ryan Reynolds?		3,3,3,3
USER	Oh, don't waste your time on that second one. They said romantic comedy and her husband dies in the beginning and the whole thing is sad!!		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh wow!		
SYSTEM	I didn't know that.		
USER	Sorry, spoilers! haha but really it is not worth it		3,3,3,2
USER	Do you have any other suggestions? I think I saw the one you mentioned		3,3,3,2
USER	I did like it		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Well what about "Bridget Jones's Diary  (2001)" ? I saw it and liked it.		
USER	I have honestly never seen that or the sequel		3,3,3,3
USER	I don't know why. I heard it was good		3,3,3,2
USER	Did you see the second one?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	They are. the original is much better than the sequel thought. It felt rushed in a way, like they were trying to hurry it through production.		
USER	Oh that's too bad when they do that.		3,3,4,3
USER	I appreciate the suggestion and I will try that one.		4,3,3,3
USER	Thank you and have a good night		3,2,3,3

USER	The last movie i watched was "Thor: Ragnarok (2017)"		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh ok. Did you see "The Snowman  (2017)"

USER	I've never even heard about it		4,3,3
USER	What is it about?		4,3,3
SYSTEM	also the movie "Philadelphia  (1993)" with tom hanks is horrifying as well.

USER	Give me some good horror films		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I've heard "It  (2017)" is really good. I still need to see it though.		
USER	I have seen it but I like the older "It (1990)" though		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Well, I'm scared of clowns so I'm not sure I want to see it.		
SYSTEM	"Annabelle  (2014)" was good and creepy.		
USER	Oh the doll movie.. shudder		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" is pretty new. It had a big buzz last year. Did you see this one?		
USER	I havent seen that one either but the trailer was crazy		3,3,4

USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello		
SYSTEM	Can I recommend a movie to you?		
USER	I'm a big fan of Brad Pitt? haven't seen all of his films but he's done many good ones.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	I love "Thelma & Louise (1991)"		
USER	I think the best stuff he's done so far is "@120003."		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I agree!		
USER	"Thelma & Louise (1991)" is good stuff?		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	What do you think of "World War Z " ?		
USER	He was also good in "12 Monkeys (1995)" even though he wasn't the star.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	That is a great one!		
USER	I liked "World War Z " a lot?		3,3,3,3
USER	I've seen the more mainstream stuff like "@107554."		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hi		
SYSTEM	How are you?		
SYSTEM	What kind of movies do you like?		
USER	Hello sorry		3,3,2,3
USER	I'm good, are you still there?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	yes, i didn't wait longer than a minute so you're fine :)		
USER	Ok :) Well my all-time favorite genre is Science fiction but I also like fantasy		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Good! Have you ever watched "Avatar  (2004)" ?		
USER	My favorite movie by reflex is probably "The Fifth Element"		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Old movie but really good. It's fantasy		
USER	I've seen Avatar and it didn't seem that old until now!		3,3,3,3
USER	It was really good but I do feel like it needs a rewatch anyway		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	"The Cloverfield Paradox (2018)" is a good movie. It's interesting and make you think hard		
SYSTEM	It's about these people going into a space and somehow getting in a different dimension (different version of their world )		
USER	No I haven't seen it but I do love thoughtful movies over chewing gum.		2,2,2,2
USER	Wow that sounds pretty good actually		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"A Quiet Place (2018)" just came out and it's sci fi / horror movie but i don't think it was that scary		
SYSTEM	It's definitely different from any other movies		
SYSTEM	because there is almost no talking and it makes you want to hold your breath		
USER	I don't really like horror but sometimes thrilling Sci-fi is okay, like "Aliens  (1986)"		3,3,2,3
USER	I'm gonna add both of those to my list		3,2,2,3
SYSTEM	That's classic		
SYSTEM	Love "Aliens  (1986)" , the cast is amazing		
SYSTEM	Would you like more suggestions?		
USER	Yeah they used to add a lot of of horror to sci-fi B movies		3,2,3,3
USER	If you have a super suggestion sure!		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I'm not sure if "Black Panther (2018)" a sci fi but it's an amazing movie		
USER	I heard mixed reviews on that one actually so I'm going to hold off on seeing it		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Out of all movies i suggested i recommend watching "A Quiet Place (2018)" first. I actually wanna watch it again it was so good		
USER	A Quiet Place then The Cloverfield Paradox, got ya		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	i hope you enjoy them. Have a great day		
USER	thanks for the suggestions :) and you too!		4,3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		4,3,3,3

SYSTEM	I thought the new "It  (2017)" was pretty scary		
SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" too		
SYSTEM	That's more of a thriller though		
USER	I loved the new "@187028!"		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I've heard great things about "@205430," but I haven't seen it yet		
USER	Sounds very interesting. Is it out in theaters now?		4,4,4,3

SYSTEM	I see, have you seen the classic "Fiddler on the Roof  (1971)" ?		
SYSTEM	it's oldie, but a goodie		
SYSTEM	or "The Sound of Music  (1965)"		
SYSTEM	and I guess there's also "Mamma Mia!  (2008)"		
SYSTEM	although I haven't seen it myself		
USER	Oh, I love "Fiddler on the Roof  (1971)" ! It really is a classic. I also love "@93497." Julie Andrews is in a lot of great musicals.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	yes i agree. also "Mary Poppins  (1964)"		
USER	"Mamma Mia!  (2008)" is good, especially if you like ABBA.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	isn't there a sequel?		
USER	I think it's coming out soon		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I was gonna say "Moulin Rouge! (2001)" but I think that's kinda sad, in fact very sad		
SYSTEM	oh, or "Chicago  (2002)" ? although I guess that can go either way		
USER	I love both those movies, so maybe I'd like happy or sad musicals! :)		4,3,4
SYSTEM	sorry I didn't make any new recommendations for you tonight		
SYSTEM	It sounds like you've seen them all!		
USER	Haha, well, you gave me some good ideas for movies I haven't seen in a while!		4,4,4

USER	Hi!		3,3,4,3
USER	What kind of movies do you like ?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Hello.		
SYSTEM	I like scary movies, like "A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)" and "@76012." Not slasher movies.		
USER	That is awesome. I love those movies.		3,3,3,3
USER	You should watch "Get Out (2017)"		3,3,3,3
USER	It is new but very good.		3,3,3,3
USER	Also, the "Seed of Chucky (2004)" is a really good horror movie.		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Yeah, those dont sound interesting.		
USER	Okay.		3,3,4,3
USER	Well, thank you for your suggestions.		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	I like more of the classic scary, not the recent ones.		
USER	I understand. I just do not like scary movies that much.		3,3,3,1
USER	Okay thank you for your time!		4,4,4,1
USER	Goodbye now.		4,4,4,1
USER	OVERALL		4,4,4,2

SYSTEM	Hey		
USER	Hi		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	What kind of film can I help you find today?		
USER	I'm looking for something to watch with my kids. They're little, so something animated and not too scary would be best		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	"@204895," is kinda cute and great for kids		
USER	Okay, they love animals		4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	"@97413," and "Sing  (2016)" went over well with my nephew when I took him to see them		
USER	My son LOVES Sing!		4,3,4,4
SYSTEM	My nephew goes around imitating the farting water buffalo, lol		
USER	It's been awhile since I watched Secret Life of Pets with them, that's a good idea		3,3,3,4
USER	Bahahaha kids are the best		3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	I know right		
SYSTEM	Did you ever take them to see "@79408," it's kind of different but a good story		
USER	I started watching that one but didn't finish. Would it be too scary for them?		3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	It has a little action, and a slightly scary guy, but overall my nephew who's nine didn't think it was scary so, your call		
USER	Okay, I might give it a try		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	It's actually based on a Japenese Folk legend that they tell their kids as a bedtime story, from what I understand		
SYSTEM	*Japanese		
USER	Interesting, I like stories with a cool background		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	Because it's Japanese they do have the obligatory &quot;big fight scene&quot; at the end with the samurai swords and what not what I honestly did not think it was scary		
USER	That actually sounds pretty cool		3,3,3,4
USER	Maybe I'll watch by myself first to see if it's something they'd like		3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	Not a bad idea, I think it is definitely more geared toward boys but a girl would like it too if she has any interest in talking monkeys or oragami		
SYSTEM	Well I gotta go, enjoy the movies		
USER	OVERALL		4,5,4,4

USER	Hello		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hi what kind of movies do you like		
USER	Any good movies you can recommend from the horror genre?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh yes have you seen "Jigsaw (2017)"		
USER	I have not, but I will check it out. Good recommendation.		4,4,2,4
USER	I love old movies like "Jaws  (1975)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	old movies are awesome a weird horror flick is "@may"		
SYSTEM	"May  (2002)"		
USER	I've seen that one. It's great		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	oh wow not many people have		
SYSTEM	I also love "Cujo  (1983)" I have a huge Stephen King fan		
USER	Cujo is a classic, but it really made me afraid of dogs		3,3,3,2
USER	Couldn't look at St Bernard's the same after that one		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	lol I showed it to my aunt when she got a new neighbor with 2 st bernards		
USER	Poor aunt		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	going along with Stephen King "Carrie  (1976)" is great too		
USER	Classic. I love Nancy Allen in that one		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	and there is a new Stephen King one that is awesome "Gerald's Game  (2017)" but that is more of a psychlogical thriller		
USER	I haven't heard of that I will check it out. See ya later.		3,2,2,3
SYSTEM	bye		
USER	OVERALL		3,2,2,2

SYSTEM	hello! what type of movies do you like? Maybe I can help ya find something good..		
USER	Hi! I'm looking for some Kid-Friendly movies to watch with my kids. Do you have an in mind?		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	oh, I know several.. first how old are your kids?		
USER	10 &amp; 8		2,2,2,1
SYSTEM	I just recently saw "Moana  (2016)" , that was a good one of course		
USER	Oh I didn't even think of "Moana  (2016)" ! i'll definitely add that to the list!		3,2,3,2
SYSTEM	I REALLY liked "The Iron Giant (1999)" but the beginning might be slightly too scary for the younger one		
SYSTEM	Also, I highly recommend "The Iron Giant (1999)" but the beginning might be slightly too scary for the younger one...		
USER	I can watch "The Iron Giant (1999)" just with the oldest. have mom/son time		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	If you don't mind Anime, I recommend "Spirited Away"		
USER	We're open to anything really. so we'll add "Spirited Away" to the list also!		4,4,4,3
SYSTEM	Anything Pixar is good, of course, "The Incredibles (2004)" , "Monsters, Inc. (2001)" Inc		
SYSTEM	"Finding Nemo (2003)" and "Toy Story (1995)" so on, but your kids probably already seen those.		
USER	Oh that reminds me! the squeal of "The Incredibles (2004)" comes out this summer! we'll definitely watch so we (mainly Me) can see the second one!		4,2,4,2
SYSTEM	If you don't mind older films, I recommend the first "The Land Before Time (1988)" didn't really see the sequels, but heard they're not as great, but still good for kids		
USER	My kids are in LOVE with "@154844!" But they haven't seen "Toy Story (1995)" That's a really good idea		4,3,4,3
USER	I haven't seen "The Land Before Time (1988)" so that'll be something we can watch together!		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	You might like "Wolf Children" but not sure about the kids, it's rather serious in parts		
USER	maybe i'll watch "Wolf Children" first to see if its okay.		3,3,2,3
USER	So many great suggestions! I really appreciate all your help!		4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	"Wolf Children" is definitely one for any parent, it's about this woman who has to raise two kids alone who can turn into wolves at will.		
USER	Oh "Wolf Children" sounds interesting!		4,2,4,4
SYSTEM	You can find clips of it on Youtube..		
SYSTEM	Anyway, I hope you enjoy the suggestions! ::)		
USER	oh good!		5,3,5,3

SYSTEM	it is very old but very funny		
USER	Oh I may try it out. . is "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002)" any good?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002)" is great, it is foreign though so you have to like subtitles		
USER	I have never heard of that or the other one. I am not sure about "A Shot in the Dark  (1964)" because I don't like movies that are too old.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	"A Shot in the Dark  (1964)" is the 1st Pink Panther film, blake edwards and whatshisname

SYSTEM	Hello		
USER	hi		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Is there any particular movie you have enjoyed in the past?		
SYSTEM	That I could use as a basis for further recommendations?		
USER	I'm looking for movies like "Aladdin  (1992)" , "Nick of Time  (1995)" , and "The Matrix (1999)" .. I also like comedies		4,3,4,3
SYSTEM	"The Matrix Revolutions (2003)" is a good choice for a "The Matrix (1999)"		
SYSTEM	You might also try "The Animatrix (2003)"		
SYSTEM	It is an animated series that explains some of the backstory		
SYSTEM	You might also like "Inception (2010)" which is a different sci-fi film		
SYSTEM	but also has great visuals		
SYSTEM	and an imaginative design		
USER	No, inception sounds good, but something down to earth		3,3,2,3
USER	i.e. "What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)"		5,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Ah "What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993)" is a great drama		
USER	Sorry, I think I had a mt.		3,2,3,3

USER	Hi		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hello, human. I mean, fellow human!		
SYSTEM	Speaking of which, know any good space movies?		
USER	I know many, I was actually looking for a space horror film		3,2,3
SYSTEM	I know a terrible one if you want a good laugh.		
SYSTEM	"Dracula 3000 (2004)" is so bad, it is funny.		
USER	know of any that are like "Alien  (1979)" ?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I love the Alien series. I suppose there are the sequels but that is hardly insightful.		
SYSTEM	The television series The Expanse is currently where I fill that gap in my life. Though that isn't a movie.		
USER	"Creature  (1985)" was a decent so bad it's good movie that was actually a response to "Alien  (1979)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I didn't know that. How about "Killer Klowns from Outer Space (1988)" for a one off night joke movie.		
USER	I love that one! cult classic		5,3,3
SYSTEM	I used to pretend the headlights of cars were clown noses and shoot them with my cousin in the backseat. Memories!		
USER	"Galaxy of Terror (1981)" was also great		4,3,4
USER	I feel that these days, movies have lost their magic		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It does seem like they rely on getting quiet and then jump scaring rather than suspense and being terrifying.		
SYSTEM	Not to mention the ongoing issue of just repeating the same story over and over.		
USER	I like movies that are well made, but I also can appreciate when the film makers did their best with the budget they were given		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Truly! "Ghostbusters (1984)" was a thousand times better than "Ghostbusters  (2016)"		
USER	many times it works very VERY well, like with "Star Wars  (1977)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen the latest Star Wars film "@96281?" I haven't gotten around to it yet.		
USER	I can also say that the best sci fi horror movie that came out of the 80's was "The Terminator (1984)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"@189494," "@170277," and "Aliens  (1986)" were the best the 80s produced! Outside of the slew of ski movies I like as a guilty pleasure.		
USER	I haven't. and I do not plan to. I prefer the original trilogy. I can watch those over and over and not get bored. "The Empire Strikes Back (1980)" is definitely the best sci fi film ever made		3,3,3
SYSTEM	And with that! I must leave. Hope to see you around!		
USER	take care!		3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,2,3

USER	Hi!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hello!		
USER	Can you suggest a good comedy for me to watch?		3,3,3
USER	I really like "@182960."		3,3,3
USER	I'm open to anything funny.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I liked it to!		
SYSTEM	"The Spy Next Door (2010)" is something that is not only hilarious but is kid friendly too.		
USER	I haven't heard of that. Who is in it?		3,3,3
USER	What is it about?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Jackie Chan, Billy Ray Cyrus, and George Lopez.		
USER	I like Jackie Chan and George Lopez. Sounds like a good cast.		4,3,3
USER	I also really liked "Jumanji  (2017)" that just came out. That was pretty fun with a good cast.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	It's about a Chinese spy ( Jackie Chan) that has to babysit his girlfriend's kids (who doesn't like him). But at the same time he has to fight off Russian spies and someone in his agency that was a double agent.		
USER	That sounds fun. I'll have to check it out. I'm sure my kids will like it.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	I have heard it is but haven't seen it.		
SYSTEM	I have seen the original though.		
USER	"Jumanji (1995)" with Robin Williams was pretty good too.		3,3,3
USER	I might have liked that one more, but the new one was funny.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Grown Ups  (2010)" and "Grown Ups 2 (2013)" are good if it's just adults and/or teens.		
USER	Those are pretty funny. I'm an Adam Sandler fan. It's been a little while since I've seen them, but they were fun.		4,3,3
USER	Thank you for the suggestion. I'll have to check it out!		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Same thing with "@111776."		
USER	That one was pretty good too, but again it has been a long time since I've seen that one.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I've heard the second will be great.		
USER	I didn't even know they are making a second one! I'll have to look into that.		3,3,3
USER	Thank you again for the suggestion. Have a good evening!		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Comes out the 20th I think.		
USER	I'm behind on new movies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	You too. Goodbye.

SYSTEM	I also love "Office Space (1999)"		
USER	I also seen the "The Hangover Part II (2011)"		4,3,3
SYSTEM	The first seemed like the best		
USER	never seen "Office Space (1999)" what’s it about?		4,3,3
SYSTEM	It's about an employee that decides he doesn't care anymore and starts living how he wants to

SYSTEM	Pretty funny		
SYSTEM	Goodbye		
USER	OVERALL		4,3,3

SYSTEM	Hi! What type of movie are you looking for?		
USER	Hi! I was looking for something along the lines of "The Sixth Sense (1999)"		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "The Babadook (2014)" ? I found it to be just as scary		
SYSTEM	I also would recommend "The Ring  (2002)" but I feel as though most people have seen it		
USER	I've seen "The Ring  (2002)" and also saw the Japanese version as well. And also watched "The Babadook (2014)" any other ideas for smart horror?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you "The Others  (2001)" ? It's probably the scariest movies I've ever seen and also managed to have a good plot		
USER	I loved "The Others  (2001)" it was very atmospheric but I didn't find it scary, it seemed almost more a mystery.		4,4,3
SYSTEM	Wow, I really thought it was scary. Maybe it was just because I watched it when I was relatively young		
USER	There was one scene where I jumped a little when the girl was in a seance with the old lady medium. That was scary.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Yes, agreed! I had nightmares for days after seeing that part		
SYSTEM	I also liked "The Cabin in the Woods"		
USER	I just watched the movie "Get Out (2017)" but dont expect any similar films like that!		3,3,2
SYSTEM	I agree! It was quite unique.		
USER	Oh haven't seen "The Cabin in the Woods" thank you I will check that out.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	You really should! It's a great film		
SYSTEM	Have a good night		
USER	you too!		4,3,3

USER	Hi, how are you?		4,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Good thanks.		
SYSTEM	Any particular type of movie you are interested in?''		
USER	I enjoy horror movies a lot		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I love the horror genre. Do you like gory or non gory?		
USER	Either or. I'm not super picky!		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Ok well I would recommend the "Saw  (2004)" series for someone who likes gory mixed with mystery.		
USER	That's a great movie, I enjoyed "Saw 3D (2010)" too		3,3,4,3,4
SYSTEM	I missed out on the 3d. I will have to check it out.		
SYSTEM	For an excellent horror without the gore, you could check out "The Conjuring (2013)" . It has been one of my favorites in recent years.		
USER	I liked that movie, but I didn't exactly love it.		4,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	And if you are interested by the boogey man, you can't go wrong with "Halloween  (1978)" , "A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)" , and "Friday the 13th  (1980)"

SYSTEM	Oh yeah, I also recommend "Coco  (2017)" . It is an animation movie.		
USER	Yes, I have heard of that one. Is it sad?		4,3,3
USER	There is happy sad, and sad sad.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	The "The Commuter  (2017)" is a thriller. The trailer is a great detailed explanation.		
SYSTEM	"Coco  (2017)" is a fun family friendly flick.		
SYSTEM	I also suggest "Dunkirk  (2017)" for a great story line.		
USER	It's a mystery? or action?		4,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello.		
USER	Hello.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hope you are having a great night. What kind of movie are you interested in?		
USER	I was hoping to discover some good movies based on animals of some kind such as "Born Free (1966)"		3,3,3
USER	I am, Thank you. I hope your night is going well too.		4,4,3
SYSTEM	Well "Old Yeller  (1957)" is truly a classic.		
USER	Yes it is. I enjoyed the movie but it was the sort of heartbreaking enjoyment that means I'll never watch it again. I have similar feelings concerning "Where the Red Fern Grows  (2003)"		3,4,3
SYSTEM	So you would like something a bit more &quot;happy&quot;?		
USER	That would be ideal but I can watch those with tragic endings, I just only watch them once.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I don't like the sad endings either.		
USER	"The NeverEnding Story  (1984)" was complete fiction and Artax came back at the end but I still cried when I watched it.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	How about "Turner & Hooch (1989)" ?		
USER	I have not seen that. I'll check it out.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes I still cry with "The NeverEnding Story  (1984)" .		
SYSTEM	I do recommend "Turner & Hooch (1989)" especially if you like Tom Hanks movies.		
USER	Cool. I will definitely watch it. Thank you.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have a great night.		
USER	Have a good night		3,4,3

USER	I'm good. Thanks		3,4,3
SYSTEM	I love horror movies too! Those are both such good movies. Have you seen "The Conjuring (2013)" ?		
USER	Yes! That was really entertaining! I liked "The Haunting  (1999)" and "Shaun of the Dead (2004)" as well.		4,4,4
SYSTEM	I have not seen "Shaun of the Dead (2004)" but "The Haunting  (1999)" was great. Have you seen "The Haunting in Connecticut (2009)" ?		
USER	Yes I liked that one as well. "It Follows (2014)" was unique as wlel.		4,4,4
SYSTEM	I also thought "Insidious  (2010)" was pretty creepy although it got a bit strange, but I haven't seen the sequels yet.		
USER	I haven't seen that one yet.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	"It Follows (2014)" looks scary		
SYSTEM	"Insidious  (2010)" made my skin crawl, you should try it. Very creepy images		
SYSTEM	Did you see "Ouija  (2014)" ?		
USER	Yeah I keep hearing good things about it. I think "It Follows (2014)" was overrated honestly. But it's still enjoyable.		3,4,3
USER	Yes I liked that one too]		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Yeah it was scary enough, the sequel was kinda lame though		
SYSTEM	"Ouija: Origin of Evil (2016)" , I think it's actually a prequel		
USER	I did enjoy the sequel as well.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Well I hope you might enjoy "Insidious  (2010)"		
USER	I'll check it out.		3,3,3

USER	I'm watching "The Shining  (1980)" right now		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"It  (2017)" is pretty scary, you should try that one.		
SYSTEM	Another scary movie is "@115463," classic horror film.		
USER	It seemed like "It  (2017)" would be a waste of time (not to open the door or anything)		3,3,2
SYSTEM	I hope I can make a good suggestion, you should try "Get Out (2017)" then, it's quite a thriller with some scary moments.		
SYSTEM	Let me know if you think that would be a good suggestion for you.		
USER	ok		2,3,2
SYSTEM	I hope you have a good day then, it was nice talking about scary movies.

USER	Hello! Can you help me find some movies with dogs in them?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes! I have always loved dog movies.		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Hachi: A Dog's Tale (2009)" with Richard Gere?		
USER	I haven't. Is it sad or happy?		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Well, kind of both. Kind of sad. It is about a dog who waits at the same train station for his owner everyday, but the owner gets sick.		
SYSTEM	Sorry, kind of a spoiler... but it is a sweet story. It based on a true story.		
SYSTEM	There is a train station in Japan and they have a statue of this dog.		
USER	That sounds really interesting actually.		4,4,4,3
SYSTEM	It's beautiful. It's kind of a popular meeting place.		
USER	Do you know any more dog movies like that?		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Another dog movie that I really loved when I was younger is "@184464."		
SYSTEM	Have you seen that one?		
USER	I have seen that one, It's really nostalgic for me.		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Me too. I don't usually love when animals talk, but I really liked this one.		
SYSTEM	What is your favorite dog movie?		
USER	Maybe not a true dog movie but i'm fond of Toto from "The Wizard of Oz  (1939)"		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh gosh. He is cute.		
SYSTEM	I also liked "@143308." It has huskies in it and I grew up with huskies.		
SYSTEM	They are beautiful dogs and the story was pretty good and exciting.		
USER	I haven't seen that. I love huskies, so that seems like a good choice.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	It was good. I just watched it with my kids and they loved it. Now they want a dog, but my son is sadly very allergic.		
SYSTEM	I hope you get a chance to watch those!		
USER	I'm putting them on my list, thank you very much.		4,4,3,3

SYSTEM	Hm, let me see...		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "The Rocketeer  (1991)" ?		
USER	I have that was a really cute movie too. It was fun. I also liked "The Host  (2013)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Is that a horror flick?		
USER	Kind of - I guess it could be considered horror. I read the books though and it felt more sci fi than horror to me		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Ah. Host... so someone taking over someone else, or a parasitic relationship?		
SYSTEM	Have you seen the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)" ? It's great.

USER	Can you recommend a few good tear jerkers?		5,3,3
SYSTEM	Hope so. Does genre or time period matter?		
USER	Not at all.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Okay well I'll start with the obvious. What about "The Notebook (2004)" ? Can't go wrong there.		
USER	I've seen it. My wife loves it!		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay, what about "Collateral Beauty (2016)" with Will Smith?		
USER	No I haven't seen that. Isn't it about death?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Sort of. It's about life in general and overcoming the hardships that go along with it.		
SYSTEM	I would also recommend "Reign Over Me (2007)" with Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler.		
USER	What's that about?		4,3,3
SYSTEM	About a guy (Sandler) who loses his famly on 9/11 and goes into a deep depression/withdrawal. The movie is about how he tries to cope with the loss afterward.		
USER	Sounds sad.		3,3,3
USER	lol		3,4,3
SYSTEM	I is, but you'll love it.		
SYSTEM	Another good one is "Seven Pounds (2008)" also starring Will Smith. It's about attonment and forgiveness.

SYSTEM	Hi there!		
USER	Hello. I am wondering if you can recommend any good movies for younger kids that aren't too dumb.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	sure! are you looking for a cartoon or live action?		
USER	Either, just stuff that's a little smarter than average.		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I really like "Charlotte's Web  (2006)"		
USER	Oh, great idea. That's a perfect example of what I'm talking about.		3,5,3,3
SYSTEM	"Inside Out  (2015)" is a great cartoon for kids.		
USER	I haven't seen that but I've heard great things about it. Do you recommend the "Toy Story (1995)" movies?		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	yes "Toy Story 3 (2010)" is a bit sad, so you may want to watch it before to see if your kids car handle it.		
USER	Okay. Will do. Now getting into the area of remakes. Is "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  (2005)" reboot good?		3,4,3,3
USER	I love the original "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)"		3,4,4,3
SYSTEM	I prefer "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)" the reboot is a little weird for weirds sake.		
USER	That's what I was wondering. How can you do better than Gene Wilder?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	agreed!		
USER	And I'm assuming there's no reason to see the "Twilight  (2008)" films		3,3,3,3
USER	at least for younger boys.		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	No, they are not going to like it.		
USER	Okay, they think they want to see it, but I tell them they won't enjoy it.		3,2,2,2

USER	if you respond, brb,		1,1,1,1,4
SYSTEM	oh sorry		
SYSTEM	yes, seen HAngover great film!		
SYSTEM	As for other comedies, I recommend "Tropic Thunder (2008)" and "The Other Guys (2010)"		
SYSTEM	If you like classics, you can't go wrong with "The Naked Gun" or "National Lampoon's Vacation (1983)"		
SYSTEM	Avoid the movie "The Hungover Games (2014)" it's just one of those lame cash-in parodies... not really funny at all

SYSTEM	I sure can! Great movie, by the way.		
USER	I kow, I am loving the main actor		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "@78418?"		
SYSTEM	Also "@169419." Thor is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarök, the destruction of his world, which is at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain Hela.		
USER	You are gonna have to work a little harder then that I'm afraid, I have watched all the "Avenger  (2006)" and "Iron Man  (2008)" movies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I did not personally watch "@78340," but heard good things. They're releasing a sequel in May.		
USER	You know that actually might hit the right note. I heard it was stupid funny and yet still action packed.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	Yup, same thing I heard!		
SYSTEM	If all else fails, watch an uplifting comedy like "Billy Madison (1995)"		
USER	Hard pass on Adam Sandler I'm afraid. But way to think outside the box with "Deadpool  (2016)" ! Thanks for the suggestion.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hope you enjoy!		
USER	I will. Have a great night!		4,3,3
SYSTEM	And OK you can pass on Sandler but you can't deny "The Waterboy (1998)" was a good movie.

SYSTEM	Did you dislike the gore		
SYSTEM	and such		
SYSTEM	I thought it was neat that Leo actually broke the glass and kept acting		
USER	The gore, the violence for violence's sake		3,3,3,3
USER	Of course Tarantino knew about the abuse that Harvey Weinstein inflicted on a lot of women		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Thank you! Goodbye!		
USER	"Natural Born Killers (1994)" is a tarrantino film that is in the same vein. A total waste of talent.		3,2,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello, what kind of movie are you looking for?		
USER	I'm looking for a film of any genre, with a woman in the lead.		3,3,3
USER	I'm in the mood for a good heroine today. :)		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "The Blind Side  (2009)" with Sandra Bullock?		
USER	No I have not.		3,3,3
USER	That's the one about her adopting the black kid right?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah, it's really good.		
SYSTEM	What about "The Help  (2011)" with Emma Stone and Viola Davis?		
USER	I'll rent it tonight.		3,3,3
USER	I did see that. It made me cry and laugh throughout.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes, definitely. Loved that one. I also really like "Precious " about the girl whose mother is real mean to her.		
USER	I tried to watch that but couldn't. It was too sad for me. I was overweight in my early 20s and it brought back so many memories.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh, yeah. It was awful. She had to deal with so much. What about "@127914." Another good Sandra Bullock film.		
USER	Is that the one based on the novel of the same name?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I'm not sure. It's about an autistic boy who loses his father on 9/11.		
USER	Yeah that's the one. I've read the book and loved it but I've never seen the movie.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	It's very sad, but very good.		
USER	I can only imagine. I cried through the entire book		4,4,3
SYSTEM	I'll have to read the book now. How about a classic now... "@198004?"		
USER	I've seen it. Love that movie. :) I watch it every valentines day, lol		4,4,3
SYSTEM	Yes. I love Audrey. She was so beautiful and elegant.		
USER	She was. :)		4,4,3
SYSTEM	Would you like some more recommendations?		
USER	These are good. I've already bought a few off Amazon to watch this weekend.		4,4,3
USER	Thanks for the help and the convo!		4,4,3
SYSTEM	You're welcome! I enjoyed it.		
USER	OVERALL		4,4,3

SYSTEM	Hello There!		
USER	Hi, I am interested in war films. Have any suggestions?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Saving Private Ryan (1998)" was a great movie.		
SYSTEM	Have you seen that before?		
SYSTEM	If you are looking for something darker I recommend "Full Metal Jacket (1987)"		
USER	I love that movie! Greatest film of all time.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I thought that was an excellent movie as well!		
USER	I've seen the second film you suggested but I didn't really like it.		3,2,3
USER	I like "We Were Soldiers (2002)" by Mel Gibson. I thought it was great.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Black Hawk Down  (2002)" is also a more realistic war movie. I did enjoy that one.		
USER	I also liked that one as well. Really sad many didn't make it out alive.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Hacksaw Ridge" was an amazing flim as well. Have you seen that one?		
USER	I saw that one in theater and it was awesome.		3,3,3
USER	I thought Mel Gibson did an awesome job portraying the story.		3,3,3
USER	And it was based on a true event.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I also saw that one in the theaters. I was surprised with how good it was.		
USER	I also like "The Patriots  (1994)"		3,3,3
USER	Great film I think it was released in early 200s.		3,3,3
USER	2000s		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I do not think I have seen that one? Who was in it?		
USER	Mel Gibson and it was about the American Revolution War with Great Britian.		2,3,3
SYSTEM	Mel Gibson does make some wonderful movies.		
USER	Exactly I like his films.		3,3,3
USER	Do you have any more suggestions?		2,3,3
SYSTEM	My last suggestion would be "Jarhead  (2005)"		
USER	I've seen parts but I didn't really like it. Too much profanity.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	I like Jake Gyllenhaal movies.		
USER	He is a great actor but didn't he play Spider Man?		3,3,4
SYSTEM	yes he did.		
USER	I also like that actor that played as Danny in "Pearl Harbor  (2001)"		3,3,3
USER	He did a great job portraying that character.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I have never seen that movie		
USER	It is a great film.		3,3,3
USER	Anyways, thank you for your suggestions. Bye.		3,3,2

SYSTEM	i havent seen it yet but i want to

SYSTEM	have you seen "Inglourious Basterds (2009)"		
USER	I liked that movie Brad Pitt hated the Nazi.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	yeah it was a good movie		
USER	I think he made another movie named "Fury  (2014)"		3,3,3
USER	?		2,3,3
SYSTEM	yes about tanks that one is good too		
USER	Great actor with great story telling.		5,3,3
SYSTEM	like him he is cool		
USER	It was sad they all died except for the new recruit.		3,3,3
USER	Kind of funny they hid in the tank.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"12 Monkeys (1995)" is another brad pitt movie		
USER	It doesn't ring a bell to me. Not really a fan.		2,3,3
SYSTEM	sorry

USER	OVERALL		3,2,3

SYSTEM	HI what kind of film do you want to see ?		
USER	How about horror		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	More psychological like "The Exorcist  (1973)" or gory like "Friday the 13th  (1980)" ?		
USER	I want it to really scare me so definitely "The Exorcist  (1973)" i		3,3,3,3
USER	Really I am open to any suggestion.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	"The Babadook (2014)" and "The Wailing  (2016)" are quite recent, also "The Cabin in the Woods" while not as scary is quite surprising		
SYSTEM	"The Wailing  (2016)" as subtitles		
USER	"The Babadook (2014)" was so good!		3,3,3,3
USER	I need to see "The Wailing  (2016)" !		3,3,2,3
USER	I have seen "The Cabin in the Woods" . Not as good as "The Last House on the Left  (1972)" The latest one		4,3,3,3
USER	Thanks for the suggestions		4,3,3,3
USER	Bye		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	oh lastly "Green Room  (2015)"		
SYSTEM	Is very good		
USER	Oh okay I will check it out too!		3,2,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,2,3,3

USER	hi there		3,3,3,3
USER	I like sci-fi's, what do you recommend?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	hey this is different, uhm, sci fi my favorite in the last 20 years is "The Matrix (1999)" I loved the fight scenes and FX		
SYSTEM	I heard they are doing a reboot, but I hope not.		
USER	really that would be interesting		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I&quot;ve heard mixed reviews about "Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)" though		
SYSTEM	some people are against once Mark Hamil spoke out about the plot.		
USER	saw that on yesterday. having mixed feelings		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Thor: Ragnarok (2017)" was pretty good. The tone switch from super serious Norse to comedy thru me for a bit though		
USER	I haven't seen it yet but I want to watch it		4,3,3,3
USER	I also wan to watch "Blade Runner 2049 (2017)"		3,3,3,3
USER	thanks for that some great suggestions there		4,4,4,2
SYSTEM	on "Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi (2017)" would you compare it more to "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)" where it was in the same universie but didn'nt feel the same or more like the other "Star Wars" movies. Same here on "Blade Runner (1982)" although I kinda wish they didn't include Harrison Ford since the original kinda left it open if he was a replicant or not.		
SYSTEM	You two later and thanks		
USER	OVERALL		4,3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hi, what kind of movies do you like?		
USER	Hi! I'm looking for a drama movie. Maybe that involves a trial.		3,3,3
USER	I loved "Amistad  (1997)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Wow, That is a good one. What about "Primal Fear  (1996)" ? or "A Few Good Men (1992)" ?		
USER	I haven't seen "Primal Fear  (1996)" but "A Few Good Men (1992)" is another movie that I've loved! It was very engaging.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Primal Fear  (1996)" has Ed Norton in it. Richard Gere too but Ed Norton is really good.		
SYSTEM	"Sleepers (1996)" is a good one but really sad.		
USER	Those are both good actors. Seems like an interesting movie that I should check out.		4,3,3
USER	I believe I have seen "Sleepers (1996)" at some point in the past. Though I really can't remember anything about it.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	It's about priest and child abuse. Kevin Bacon and Brad Pitt.		
USER	Oh yeah I know what that was. I did like that one!		4,3,3
USER	It was very emotional but definitely a good movie.		4,3,4
SYSTEM	Yes. I cried. That one came out right when all that kind of stuff was starting to surface. Crazy how far we have come in uncovering so much.		
SYSTEM	Wow, good chat! Thanks so much and have a great day!

SYSTEM	I agree but I liked it for the pure entertainment factor		
SYSTEM	Have you ended up watching "The Conjuring 2 (2016)" ?		
USER	I do like the smaller independent movies they've been doing in the genre lately. Have you seen "Get Out (2017)"		4,3,3

SYSTEM	I did but it wasnt that great in my opinion.

USER	I love the suspense and twists that you get in thrillers, like "@double" jep		4,3,3,3
USER	"Double Jeopardy  (1999)"		4,3,3,3
USER	Or murder mysteries in "High Crimes (2002)" with Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman.		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	I Love "The Ring  (2017)"		
USER	That movie is okay, but I'm not a fan.		2,2,2,3
SYSTEM	"Wonder Woman  (2017)" is also good		
SYSTEM	I am fan marvel		
USER	That is not a thriller though. Marvel is more action than thriller.		4,3,3,3
USER	Can you recommend thriller movies for that genre?		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	"Sinister  (2012)"		
USER	More horror/paranormal, but that movie is okay. Not a big fan		2,2,2,3

SYSTEM	"The Silence of the Lambs  (1991)"		
USER	That is a good thriller, I enjoyed that movie a lot.		4,4,3,4

USER	Yes. Looking for a good horror film. Something with a monster or evil entity of some kind		3,3,3
SYSTEM	did you watch the movie "Get Out (2017)" ?		
USER	I did. I thought it was good. Very psychological.		3,3,3
USER	:)		3,4,3
SYSTEM	yes it is a great movie		
SYSTEM	in that case .. I think you would like "The Omen  (2006)"		
USER	Is that a new version of the original series, or a remake?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	it is a new version of the original "The Omen (1976)"		
USER	Oh okay. I might like that then. I enjoyed the original. :)		3,3,3

USER	Hello.. How are you? I am looking for some good horror movies. Something along the lines of "Saw  (2004)"		2,2,3
SYSTEM	"Don't Say a Word (2001)"		
SYSTEM	was a really good one along those lines		
USER	I didn't like that movie. It had Michael Douglas in it. It wasn't a horror movie. I want something with gore like the original "A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984)"		4,2,2
USER	"Don't Say a Word (2001)" is too much like "Cellular  (2004)" it was just a kidnapping movie.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	"Cannibal  (2006)" or "Blood Feast (1963)" was good		
SYSTEM	"The Silence of the Lambs  (1991)" was also gory and somewhat captivating		
USER	"Blood Feast (1963)" is too early to have gore. I saw "Cannibal  (2006)" it was okay, but I guess I'm looking for something newer.		3,2,2
SYSTEM	"The Devil's Candy (2015)" was good		
USER	Can you tell me about "The Devil's Candy (2015)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	it's about a struggling painter possessed by satanic forces and how his wife tries to save him		
USER	I guess I can check it out, thank you.		3,3,4

SYSTEM	Greetings, I certainly could help with that.		
SYSTEM	Let me think for a second.		
SYSTEM	One of my favorites when I was a kid was "@130891." Have you seen that?		
USER	Yes. And I agree it was really good.		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Ah, I liked "2012  (2009)" as well but it was not as good.		
USER	I agree "2012  (2009)" was a dissappointment.		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	How about "@76802?" It's a little different of a disaster, but a great movie.		
USER	I really liked "The Core (2003)" even though it was kind of campy.		4,3,4,3
USER	Oh I haven't heard of "Contagion  (2011)"		3,3,3,2
USER	Tell me about it.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Well I don't want to spoil too much, however a virus breaks out when this woman returns from a business trip. She dies and it's super awful after that.		
USER	Sounds interesting. I think I will check it out. Thanks so much for your help, and have a good day.		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Sure, you too.

When a masked killer suddenly takes her life in a brutal attack, she once again magically wakes up in Carter's dorm room unharmed. Now, the frightened young woman must relive the same day over and over until she figures out who murdered her.

SYSTEM	"Requiem for a Dream (2000)" with Jared Leto is also an amazing movie		
USER	But, I would like to know more movies that are well thought out.		3,2,3,2
USER	Have not seen that one either.		3,2,3,2
SYSTEM	"Inception (2010)" is a movie that took an insane amount of thought		
USER	I really enjoyed that one when I saw it.		4,3,3,3

SYSTEM	"Forrest Gump (1994)" has a good story plot, and evokes a lot of emotions. It's definitely on my top 10 list

USER	I have seen that one, and I think it deserves it hype.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Awakenings (1990)" is number 2 on my list, since I suffered a coma from encephalitis when I was 13. It's a very emotional movie.		
USER	I have never heard of it, I will have to add it to my list.		4,4,4,2
SYSTEM	"The Butterfly Effect (2004)" is an amazing movie too. It makes you question a lot.

SYSTEM	Have you seen "The Sixth Sense (1999)" ?

USER	Any suggestions?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay! "Deep Impact  (1998)" is like that.		
SYSTEM	Oh, and "The Perfect Storm  (2000)" is a great one about a natural disaster.		
SYSTEM	And one that I just watched recently is "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World (2012)" but beware, it's super depressing.

SYSTEM	The movie "It  (2017)" is certainly has the scary clown factor in it!		
SYSTEM	I haven't seen "Bride of Chucky (1998)" but that's because I'm a big chicken! But it would have to be a great movie to get a sequel!		
USER	Have you seen anything new with Tom Hanks?		4,3,3

USER	I think I will try that movie it sounds interesting enough for me!		3,3,3,4

USER	Hello		3,3,3,3

USER	I'm looking for something dark and mysterious		3,3,2,3
USER	I liked "Angels & Demons  (2009)" and "Nightcrawler  (2014)"		3,4,3,3
USER	As well as "Donnie Darko (2001)" and "10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)" ld		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	A little different in my opinion.		
USER	Thank you for that recommendation. I always enjoy seeing films that stand apart		4,4,2,4

SYSTEM	It will make you laugh and cry at the same time.		
USER	Those are the best		4,4,3,4

SYSTEM	Any genre you are looking for to watch today?		
USER	I'm looking for a good horror movie.		3,3,3
USER	I recently saw "It  (2017)" and loved it.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It is good! Also from last year was "@144779." Have you seen those?		
USER	I have seen the first "Annabelle  (2014)" and liked it, but i haven't seen "Annabelle 2 (2017)" yet.		4,4,3
USER	Was it good?		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I liked it though it was a bit predictable.		
USER	That's what I figured.		4,3,3
SYSTEM	I am also a fan of the Alien series so "Alien: Covenant (2017)" is pretty much horror.		
USER	I saw that one recently. It was pretty good, but also predictable I thought.		4,4,3
USER	Any other suggestions?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	What about "It Comes at Night (2017)" which made me jump a few times.		
USER	I haven't seen that one.		2,3,2
USER	What's it about?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	A family seeks refuge at a rural house and I don't want to give the rest away!

USER	Hi!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hi there. What sorts of movies are you looking for today?		
USER	Could you suggest a good tear jerker movie?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hmmm.....does genre or time period matter?		
USER	Something from the 90's or newer		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Okay, I'm not sure what you would consider a tear jerker, but I'll give a few that got me in the feels, lol.		
SYSTEM	There's "Up  (2009)" from Disney Pixar. It's animated but the story hits home in a lot of ways.		
SYSTEM	Then there's "Collateral Beauty (2016)" with Will Smith and Helen Mirren.		
SYSTEM	Also, though it's not a &quot;tear jerer&quot; per se, the ending did make me cry a bit. "Odd Thomas  (2013)" with Anton Yelnich. I guess it's even more so difficult to watch knowing he's passed since then.		
USER	Maybe something more along the lines of "I Am Sam (2001)" or "Forrest Gump (1994)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hmm.... let me see.....		
SYSTEM	Hae you ever seen "Dancer in the Dark (2000)" ?		
SYSTEM	It's about an almost-blind Czech immigrant whose only way of escaping the horrors of a murder trial are by starring in her own musicals.		
USER	No I havent		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Gets me everytime.		
USER	I'll check it out		3,3,3
USER	Thank you		4,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

USER	I was wondering if you could recommend a good movie.		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	I'm great! How are you doing? Can I recommend a movie?		
SYSTEM	Sure what kind of movie are you looking for?		
USER	Great! I would like to see a movie that is inspirational.		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	okay have you seen "@113392?" It's a great movie kind of sad but inspirational.		
USER	I like movies like "The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)" with Will Smith. It was really good.		4,3,3,4
USER	HOw funny.		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	Ha! We're on the same page then. That was a great one		
USER	It was, made me cry.		4,3,3,3
USER	What else is good?		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Same here. Another one that I thought was great was "The Blind Side  (2009)" with Sandra Bullock. That one made me cry too. But it was SO good		
USER	I haven't seen that one.		4,3,3,3
USER	"Awakenings (1990)" was good.		4,4,4,3
SYSTEM	It's really good another one I would recommend would be "Forrest Gump (1994)"		
SYSTEM	I haven't seen that one		
USER	"Forrest Gump (1994)" is with Tom Hanks right?		4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	yes. I love Tom Hanks. It's been awhile since I've seen that but I remember it was a tearjerker for me lol		
USER	That sounds like a good one to watch. Thank you for the suggestions.		4,4,4,4
SYSTEM	No problem. Hope I've helped. HAve a good night!		
USER	OVERALL		4,3,4,4

USER	Do you have any recommendations? Thanks!		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Let me think...		
SYSTEM	How about "13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016)"		
SYSTEM	"Hacksaw Ridge" was good. Did you see that?		
USER	I love both of them.		5,3,3
USER	The second option you mentioned was sad.		3,3,2
USER	The first film you stated above was really sad as well.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	They are all sad in my opinion.		
USER	They were set up and gave their lives for our freedom.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Black Hawk Down  (2002)" ws another		
USER	I like that one as well.		3,3,3
USER	I still cannot imagine what happened on that day when things went wrong.		3,3,3
USER	Those soldiers gave their best. Many didn't make it home.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	That is right

USER	Ah yes, I loved that one.		4,3,3
USER	They really nailed the remake		4,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Dead End  (2003)"		
USER	No I haven't, is it good?		3,2,2
SYSTEM	They did. i thought Tim Curry was scary but this clown was scarier		
SYSTEM	"Dead End  (2003)" is definitely not for the faint hearted		
USER	Cool, that sounds right up my ally.		5,3,3
USER	I will check it out for sure.		4,3,3
USER	Thank you, and have a good day!		4,3,3

SYSTEM	"The Emoji Movie (2017)" was rated one of the worst of the year, but I've watched it 350 times with my daughter and don't think it's terrible		
USER	I like watching movies critics dislike because they are usually pretty good.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	the new "Goosebumps  (2015)" was pretty good as well

USER	They have already seen ones like "Pokémon: The Movie 2000 (1999)" and "@185954."		3,3,3

SYSTEM	It really is good haha		
SYSTEM	Hope you enjoy!		
USER	Isn't the new one the one with Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gilan?		3,3,3

USER	I prefer a little bit lighter romance.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah, that totally doesn't count.		
SYSTEM	How about "@138546?"		
USER	I haven't heard of it. What's it about?		1,3,3

USER	I haven't seen either one of those. What are they about?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Father Figures (2017)" is a movie aboue the hunt for a set of twins bio dad.Its got Owen Smith in it. And "Daddy's Home 2 (2017)" is about the step parenting		
USER	Oh ok. They both sound good.		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I also watched "Ingrid Goes West (2017)" Its supposed to be a comedy but it more freaked me out than made me laugh.		
USER	I haven't seen that one, either.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Its about social media stalking. but its listed under comedy		
USER	Hmm, that sounds intriguing.		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	It is especially how much social media runs everyone life these days.		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Bad Moms (2016)" or "A Bad Moms Christmas (2017)" ?		
USER	Yeah it's sad how much people let it control their lives.		3,3,3,3

USER	I like his movies so much!		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes! if you like robin williams, I'm sure you'd like "Dead Poets Society (1989)"		
SYSTEM	That movie was so inspiring.		
USER	Is it slapstick funny, like "¡Three Amigos! (1986)" or deeper?		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	It's not really a comedy, it just has robin williams in it		
SYSTEM	It's actually kind of sad as one of the main characters commits suicide		
USER	Oh, I really would like a comedy.		3,2,3,3
USER	Something cheerful.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Ooops. sorry about that!

USER	No i havent		3,3,2
USER	Have you seen "Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014)" ?		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello. I hope you are doing well today. Is there any specific genre you are interested in?		
USER	HI can you suggest a good movie in that is action packed?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Action packed movies.. Have you seen "The Bourne Ultimatum  (2007)" ?		
USER	I haven't seen that movie. Is it a good one?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I enjoyed it. It has a lot of action and a complex storyline. There are other movies before it though. It's a series starting with "The Bourne Identity  (2002)" I think.		
SYSTEM	This movie is a bit older but it has lots of action in "Repo Men (2010)"		
USER	I have seen Bourne Identity and it was good.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	You will probably like the following movies then. I like the ones featuring Jeremy Renner better than the series with Matt Damon. Have you ever watched "Looper  (2012)" ?		
SYSTEM	I absolutely loved that movie.		
USER	Have you seen "@83552?"		3,3,3
USER	I watched it this week at the theater and it was great.		3,4,3

USER	This was the first movie I seen in a while at the the theater.		3,3,3
USER	"Justice League  (2017)" was a really good movie too. Have you seen it by chance?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Going to the theater is expensive, especially with a family. The last movie we saw in the theater was "Thor: Ragnarok (2017)"		
SYSTEM	Yes. I love the comic based movies		
SYSTEM	I thought about recommending movies like "Suicide Squad  (2016)" but most people already know them.		
USER	Those are my families favorite. Yes it is very expensive.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	My family too. They are what we watch together.		
USER	I love Suicide Squad.		3,3,3
USER	I am looking forward to "Black Panther (2018)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I am too. We will be going to the theater to see it. We try not to miss any marvel movies when they come out. We were hooked after "The Avengers  (2012)"		
USER	That was a good one to watch. We have all marvel movies out of dvd.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	That is a good plan.		
SYSTEM	I hope you enjoy your weekend and catch some good movies.		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

USER	Hi, any good movies you think I could rent on Amazon?		3,3,3,3,3
USER	I mean just an older move, not need to search Amazon		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	sure.. It gets difficult sometimes because the studios move their stock around based on contract and so they don't always have what you think they will. Like netflix.. good, but different than you might expect from a pay per view channel		
USER	Yeah, i don't like Netflix for movies because they have a lot of B movies.		3,3,3,2,2
SYSTEM	Well, "A Ghost Story (2017)" is available		
USER	I wish they had more movies like "The Terminator (1984)"		3,3,3,2,3

SYSTEM	Hi!		
SYSTEM	I do. How do you like "Captain America: Civil War (2016)"

SYSTEM	That was a good movie.		
USER	British historical stuff is good.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Have you tried "@183296," or "@102007?"		
SYSTEM	Yes, it is. I liked "Henry IV  (1984)"		
USER	I never heard of "@183296."		3,3,2
USER	Except as a country western song.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	It is a great movie.		
USER	Is it drama?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I don't listen to country songs. yes, it is a drama		
USER	I will have to check out "@204125." Is it straight Shakespeare?		3,3,3

SYSTEM	I know what you mean! What kind of movies do you like?		
USER	Well, I think I would like to switch it up.		3,3,3
USER	I wanted to know from you what the lousiest movie you've ever been forced to watch was.		2,3,3
USER	Like you wanted to walk out of the theater, but couldn't.		3,3,3
USER	Or you were trapped watching it and couldn't escape.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"@116125." I was with my friends who were laughing so hard and I couldn't even fake a laugh. I was with my boyfriend too.		
SYSTEM	It was painful. Have you seen it?		
USER	I did, and I liked it. But I realize it's not for everyone. You kinda have to be from the empty Western US states to 'get it'. I do live the next state over from ID.		3,3,3
USER	To someone from New Jersey, it would be an alien culture.		3,3,3
USER	That movie is about Mormons.		3,3,3
USER	Mormon way of life. Never mentioned at all in the movie, but it's abundantly clear to people who know.		3,3,3
USER	Sorry, didn't mean to be a pest there.		3,1,3
SYSTEM	I must have missed that. I'm very familiar with the religion.		
USER	Ah, okay say no more.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	Well another painful one was "You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008)" with Adam Sandler.		
USER	Heh. Now that's the religion I'm familiar with. :D		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Poor Adam Sandler, he has quite a few that were pretty bad. Did you see that one?		
USER	It was painful indeed.		3,3,3
USER	I did. The beach scene with the ocean perch in his rear end cheeks.		3,3,3
USER	Made me wanna leave.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh gosh... don't remind me!		
USER	It is kinda Tel Aviv-y		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Kind of different, but did you see "@176558?"		
USER	Is that the one that iTunes gave away for free? With the kids?		3,3,3
USER	It's like zero out of five stars.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Probably. That movie cost so much to make and they had to have lost so much money.		
USER	Let that be a lesson to them I guess		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It had a big cast, but didn't quite come together well.		
USER	My offering is for "Popeye  (1980)"		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I don't know that one?		
USER	It's a Robin WIlliams film so you might stumble across it and think it might be good. It is so lousy that it will give you gas.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Too bad. I really liked him.		
USER	It's old, but was supposed to have been a landmark musical. Cost a fortune to make. Try to imagine a musical based around the Popeye cartoon character.		3,3,3
USER	The whole movie is singing.		3,3,3
USER	BAD singing.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh wow. That just sounds awful. I like some musicals, but this just doesn't sound right.		
USER	hehhe		3,3,2
USER	I agreee		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Well, I hope you have a good night. Bye!		
USER	night		3,3,2

USER	Hi there!		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hello		
USER	I'm looking for movies that will scare me out of my seat.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	so you like horror movies ?		
USER	Yes. Movies like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  (2003)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Ouija  (2014)" ?		
SYSTEM	I haven't seen that movies		
USER	Yes I have, good movie. unexpected ending.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	have you seen "Final Destination  (2000)" ?		
SYSTEM	And scary too		
USER	Yes I have, those movies are classics.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	am happy you like them		
SYSTEM	well thanks for your suggestion have a good one		
USER	Do you have 1 more suggestion?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes i do		
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem (2007)" ?		
USER	No I haven't, but I'll check it out. Thanks!		3,3,3,3
USER	Goodbye		2,3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4,3

SYSTEM	hi		
USER	Hi. How are you		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	good just trying to look for a great horror		
USER	I am looking for a movie that has suspense and is thrilling but not with gore		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	cool, looks like we have the same taste in movies		
SYSTEM	that means you will love "The Conjuring (2013)" "The Exorcist  (1973)" "Annabelle  (2014)" "The Shining  (1980)"		
USER	I am seeking a movie that makes me sit on the edge of my seat but not scare me to death		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	all 4 of these are perfect		
USER	I like the "The Shining  (1980)" and the "The Exorcist  (1973)" but not the others you mentioned		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	yeah the other two can be a bit much		
USER	I don't want to see a demonized doll. I rather see people handling usually situations that give you suspense		2,2,2,3
SYSTEM	What makes the difference between them?		
SYSTEM	ohhhhh ok, i understand i was wondering why		
SYSTEM	that's a good reason but that is what happens in the supernatural world		
SYSTEM	especially when it is a reality		
USER	Having object come to life and terrorize people is too much. There is enough things in life that can give you heart a jolt not objects.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	yeah, but that is what makes "Annabelle  (2014)" movie so fascinating		
SYSTEM	the fact of not truly knowing why it happens		
SYSTEM	well, i hope i gave you some good suggestions to start off with		
SYSTEM	have a good night ok

USER	Is "Another Cinderella Story (2008)" the one with Chad Micahel Murray?		2,3,3

USER	Hi there, I am loving Asian Horrors right now. My new favorite is "The Wailing  (2016)"		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you ever seen "Shutter  (2012)"		
SYSTEM	It is terrifying!		
USER	No, I haven't. I will add that to my list. Any others?		4,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Well, of course "The Grudge (2004)" and although not Asian, and a bit older "The Ring  (2002)" is a frightening film with Asian overtones.		
USER	Both excellent! You have great taste in movies! Now I have to decide which one to watch		3,3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Oh thank you! I hope you enjoy my suggestions!		
USER	I will most likely watch "Shutter  (2012)"		3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Shutter  (2008)" still creeps me out when I think about it.		
SYSTEM	It is an interesting, frightening film that will stick with you for years!		
USER	I look forward to it, thank you so much for the suggestions		4,4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	It's got a believable storyline...and that makes it both realistic and soooo frightening!

USER	I don't care for "@152744;" not my type of movie.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	How about "The Goonies (1985)" I liked that one a lot.		
SYSTEM	If you like the older ones "Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986)" was cute too!		
USER	I liked "Pretty in Pink (1986)" and "@82602," are they considered Sci-fi?		3,3,3
USER	Oh, I don't like "@163619," it was boring to me.		3,3,2

USER	I heard "Mother! (2017)" is very scary with a twist ending. Have you seen it		3,3,4
SYSTEM	I havent actually but Ive hear good things about it		
USER	What about "It  (2017)" the remake with the clown		3,3,3
SYSTEM	if you like terror movies then you will like "Annabelle  (2014)" and "Annabelle 2 (2017)"		
USER	I heard that "It  (2017)" was disturbing and these type of movies are why a lot of people do not like clowns		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I liked the old version of the movie so im guessing the newer one must be great as well.		
USER	Another one I was thinking about was "Ted  (2012)"		3,4,4
USER	"Ted  (2012)" has the bear that comes &quot;alive&quot; . I heard it was funny		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It is pretty funny, ive seen that one and I liked it a lot		
SYSTEM	its a blast		
USER	Who is the main star of "Ted  (2012)"		3,3,3
USER	I cannot think of his name		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Marc Wahlberg is the name of the main actor		
USER	I think he and his brother own a restaurant in Boston. I heard he was really good in the "Ted  (2012)" movie. I think I will rent it. Good speaking with you		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah you will probably enjoy it

USER	i actually love all the saw movies. "Saw III (2006)" was probably my favorite		2,3,3
SYSTEM	I've seen the whole series myself. The only one I distinctly remember is "@115463." The rest seemed kind of gimmicky.		
USER	true "Saw 3D (2010)" had a good ending but it was def on the gimmicky side		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Kind of reminds me of "Jaws 3-D (1983)" or any of those 3D movies really.		
USER	haha i liked "Jaws " that will always be a classic		3,4,4
SYSTEM	Oh yeah! The first one is absolutely great!

USER	Can you help me pick a movie to watch?		3,3,3
USER	I really like Tom Hanks		3,4,3
SYSTEM	You should watch "Captain Phillips  (2013)"		
USER	I never saw that?		3,2,3
SYSTEM	Remarkable acting for tom hanks		
USER	what's it about?		3,2,3
SYSTEM	It is about a ship captain who was kidnapped by somali pirates		
SYSTEM	Tom hanks was the captain		
USER	Maybe, but lets keep brainstorming		3,2,3
USER	I really liked "Sleepless in Seattle (1993)"		3,4,4
SYSTEM	"Inferno  (2016)" or tom hanks too		
USER	I already saw that one.		3,2,3
USER	it was pretty good.		3,4,4

SYSTEM	"Cast Away (2000)"		
SYSTEM	And "Big  (1988)" a good one

SYSTEM	ha! nah bro. which one though? the older ones or the remake in like late 90s?		
USER	The older versions. I didn't see the remake. I was afraid it would suck.		2,3,2,2,3
SYSTEM	it does.		
USER	I've seen all the original except for "Psycho III (1986)"		3,3,3,5,3
SYSTEM	yah me too. never got around to watching the third one. second was okay. not as shocking like the first. nothing ever beats the original		
USER	What about "Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)" ?		3,3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	well that one yah but not many sequals surpass the original.		
USER	True true. "Aliens  (1986)" was another one.		3,3,3,5,3
SYSTEM	yah. too bad "Prometheus  (2012)" didnt follow suit		
USER	I liked "Prometheus  (2012)" . I thought it was a good film.		4,4,2,2,4

USER	Me too! They're my favorite!		4,3,4
SYSTEM	Have you watched "Insidious: Chapter 4 (2018)" ? i wouldn't say it's as scary as "Insidious  (2011)" but it's pretty good		
USER	Yes, I have seen both of those, they're very good. I also liked "The Conjuring 2 (2016)"		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Also I'm pretty sure you've already watched "It  (2017)" because i feel like everybody watched it but i strongly recommend watching the original "It (1990)"		
USER	Actually, I have watched the original "It (1990)" but not the new "It  (2017)"		3,3,3
USER	Great idea!		4,3,4
SYSTEM	You should watch it! I honestly really love the original but the new "It  (2017)" is pretty scary too! They added some things which were not in the original movie		
USER	I will definitely have to try it. My whole family likes to snuggle down with the lights off and watch it together. We love movie night.		3,3,4

USER	howdy		3,3,3
SYSTEM	What kinds of movies turn you on		
SYSTEM	I know loads about film		
SYSTEM	They call me the asian Roger Ebert.		
USER	I'm not a horror fan but just seen movie on HBO "Get Out (2017)" I hear it's up for a couple oscars.		3,3,3
USER	hahaha Roger		4,3,3
SYSTEM	If you like action I here tha "Baby Driver  (2017)" is great stuff.		
USER	Have you seen "Get Out (2017)" ?		3,4,3
SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" was fantastic. Have you seen "The Usual Suspects (1995)" it's a really suspenceful film		
SYSTEM	I love "Get Out (2017)"		
USER	I wanted horror. Not action.		2,3,2
USER	and "Get Out (2017)" was funny as well.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	It's not an action film. It's psychological suspense which is something else.		
SYSTEM	Maybe you would like "@194607."		
USER	is that modern and funny as well as horror?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's a very scary film.		
SYSTEM	You would I think like "Freaks (1932)" its a trip.		
USER	does it make fun of modern US racism?		3,2,3
SYSTEM	No it doesn't but you will like it? Its about Carnival 'freaks'?		
SYSTEM	What's the best horror film ever?		
USER	I haven't seen any of those so I can try them out. I was looking for something contemporary -ish		3,3,3
USER	I thought "The Exorcist  (1973)" was pretty scary		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I would tell you to try "Annabelle: Creation (2017)"		
USER	ok I will check those out, thank you		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Anyway nice chatting with you?		
SYSTEM	Bye.		
USER	yes, bye		3,3,3

USER	But not too scary		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Like "Shutter Island  (2010)" ?		
USER	Yeah, like that		3,4,3,4
USER	Or even something like "Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011)"		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	I can't think of any more...grrr		
SYSTEM	I like somewhat older movies...did you like "50 First Dates (2004)" ?

SYSTEM	lol

USER	lol		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah, even Lindsey Lohan was cute in "The Parent Trap  (1998)"

USER	Drew Barrymore is pretty well adjusted despite being a kid actor		2,2,3,3
SYSTEM	How about "The Sixth Sense (1999)" ?		
SYSTEM	Talk about twist...		
USER	Oh, good one!		4,4,3,4
SYSTEM	Or "Other People  (2016)" ?		
SYSTEM	No, wait, that was not the one I was thinking about...		
USER	I haven't seen that one		3,1,3,3

SYSTEM	I recently watched "Wonder Woman  (2017)" and I was a bit disappointed.

SYSTEM	I watched "Get Out (2017)" and I really liked it.		
USER	Oh I have not seen "Get Out (2017)" yet, but I really want to. What did you like about it?		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" starts out a bit slow but it's one of those movies that keep you glued to the screen.		
USER	Would you say that it is a horror movie? Because I don't usually like horror movies.		3,3,3,4

USER	Oh! Maybe I will watch it. Too bad you don't like scary movies. I guess "Freddy vs. Jason (2003)" is out of the question then. That is a gory one! haha		2,2,4
USER	Looks like I will give "Mama  (2013)" a chance tonight then.		3,3,4
SYSTEM	oh I guess there are gory/slasher film		
SYSTEM	or ghost stories		
SYSTEM	I don't mind the slasher ones, although not big fan		
SYSTEM	but ghost ones are scary!		
SYSTEM	but both "The Sixth Sense (1999)" and "The Others  (2001)" are smart

USER	I think I will have them watch that movie, thatnk youso much.		3,3,3
USER	Goodbye.		3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		2,3,3

USER	Hi, i am looking for a good horror movie to watch tonight.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hello. Horror is a good genre, do you think you'd want something classic or more recent?		
USER	I would prefer more recent.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Excellent. One of the better recent horror movies is "Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012)"		
USER	Never heard of that one. What is it about? I just watched the new "It  (2017)" movie and didn't find it scary. Is it anything like "It  (2017)" ?		2,3,3
SYSTEM	It's a revenge horror movie where a father avenges the death of his son by hunting the people who killed him.		
SYSTEM	I also saw "It  (2017)" and didn't find it scary. It was still a good movie though.		
SYSTEM	Another movie you could try is "The Conjuring (2013)" it's pretty recent and I enjoyed it. Good reviews too.		
USER	I will have to check out "Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012)" . What is the scariest movie you have seen? The scariest movie I have ever seen is "The Strangers  (2008)"		3,3,3
USER	Yes I enjoyed "The Conjuring (2013)" also.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	The scariest movie I have ever seen probably isn't very scary but has to do with how old I was when I saw it. I'd say it was "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)" . I was young when I saw it so it was quite a fright.		
SYSTEM	I have never seen "The Strangers  (2008)" but I might look into it, thanks!		
USER	My sister and her boyfriend took me to see "Child's Play  (1988)" when I was 8. Scary for my age, but watch it now and it's not so scary. So I know what you mean.		3,2,3
USER	Thanks for the recommendation of "Nobody Gets Out Alive (2012)" I am going to go check it out Have a great day.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes, Chucky was scary as kid for me too!		
SYSTEM	You too!		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,2

SYSTEM	Hey. What kind of movies are you into?		
USER	Horror movies are my favorite.		3,4,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Cult of Chucky (2017)" that one as pretty scary.		
USER	I have not. The first one was a little weird though.		3,3,3
USER	There's just something I don't like about dolls.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I understand that. "Annabelle: Creation (2017)" is a good one and so is "10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)"		
USER	I may have to check those out.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I really liked "The Conjuring 2 (2016)"		
USER	Oh, that's a good one. Thanks for the suggestion!		4,4,3
SYSTEM	You're welcome. Have a good one!		
USER	You too, bye!		4,4,3
USER	OVERALL		4,4,3

USER	Hi.		3,3,3,3
USER	☺		2,2,3,3
SYSTEM	hi! what movies do you like		
SYSTEM	i like scary movies		
USER	A good thriller. Recent if possible.		3,3,3,3
USER	Maybe a foreign flick I haven't actually seen.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	what about "The Girl with All the Gifts  (2016)"		
USER	That was a good one. I think that was Australian (?)		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	i think so! have you also seen "Annabelle 2 (2017)"		
USER	Yes. Not bad. "The Conjuring (2013)" was actually pretty scary though.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	oh my i loved that movie!		
USER	You like really scary movies.		3,3,3,3
USER	How about "The Exorcist  (1973)" ?		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	that one scares me because of how they say its based on a real story		
USER	It's almost too scary for a lot of people.		2,3,3,3
USER	It's funny how they keep trying to make exorcism movies and they are never scary, except that one.		3,3,3,3
USER	"The Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)" was kind of scary though.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	i agree!		
USER	Also a true story.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	thats true. it really was!		
SYSTEM	can you imagine of how scary that would be in real life		
USER	It's not something you want to really contemplate.		2,2,3,2
SYSTEM	very true! did you like "It  (2017)"		
SYSTEM	i didnt real care for it. not cause the clown but cause the movie just did nothing for me		
USER	Yes. Not so much scary as just a good plot. The bully kid was scarier than the monster.		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	i agree		
USER	"The Dark Tower  (2017)" is another decent Stephen King movie recently.		3,2,3,3
USER	Well it's been great chatting with you.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	i liked that one as well. and you as well. goodbye		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4,3

SYSTEM	hello		
USER	hi how are you?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	im good, and you		
USER	excellent! I was wondering if you could suggest a film that was like "Apollo 13  (1995)" I just saw it again and loved it.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	I like movies like "Batman Begins"		
SYSTEM	sure let me think quick		
SYSTEM	"Armageddon  (1998)" i believe was something like that		
USER	Honestly I'm not a big fan of the Batman genre. Haven't seen "Batman Begins"		2,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Not a big fan of the marvel		
USER	I've seen "Armageddon  (1998)" so any others you can suggest?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	was "Cast Away (2000)" similar		
SYSTEM	"Galaxy Quest (1999)" was another good one		
USER	no "Castaway  (1986)" was with tom hands but it wasn't about space.		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	oh yeah thats right		
USER	what was "Galaxy Quest (1999)" about?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	its about a spacecraft that was found on the bottom of the ocean		
SYSTEM	I dont want to spoil it for you		
USER	Hmmm that sounds interesting, I think I'll look for that, thank you.		4,3,4,3
SYSTEM	your welcome		
SYSTEM	thank you for talking with me		
USER	you too, have a nice weekend.		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	thanks bye

SYSTEM	hey		
USER	Hey!		3,3,3,3
USER	So do you have a favorite comedy movie?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	I haven't seen any recently but i though "Big Stan (2007)" was quite funny		
SYSTEM	any recent suggestions?		
USER	Oh, I have never heard of that one! I love comedies. I recently watched "Logan Lucky (2017)" and really enjoyed it,		2,3,3,3
USER	What types of movies do you like?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	i must check it out. i think its Rob Schneider is the actor in it. He also did another few comedies "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo (2005)" which was funny too lol I'm into success movies. pretty much seen them all but interested in new 2018 ones		
SYSTEM	I also liked some silly comedies like "The Naked Gun"		
USER	I have never been a big Rob Schneider fan. He is just ok to me. I do love anything with Adam Sandler in it though.		2,3,2,3
SYSTEM	and "Hot Shots! (1991)" lol		
USER	My husband has recently tried to get me to watch "Super Troopers (2001)" because he is excited about the sequel coming out. I just can't get into it.		1,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Nope didn't like it if i recall the ending was silly		
USER	I did not make it past the first 10-15 minutes. Not my type of funny.		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	What Adam Sandler films do you like?		
USER	"Pixels  (2015)" , "Grown Ups  (2010)" , "Jack and Jill  (2011)" , "Bedtime Stories  (2008)" , "I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry (2007)" , "The Wedding Singer (1998)" , "The Longest Yard  (2005)"		3,3,3,3
USER	There are so many good ones. "Mr. Deeds (2002)" was pretty good also		3,3,3,3
USER	and "Happy Gilmore (1996)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Cool, "Grown Ups 2 (2013)" is good too. thanks for the suggestions i think that is us completed :)		
USER	Thanks for chatting with me! I will check out "Grown Ups 2 (2013)"		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	ok bye :)		
USER	OVERALL		2,3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hello		
SYSTEM	Have you seen any films that you particularly liked recently?		
USER	Yes. I recently saw "@205821," it was great. Do you know any movies like that?		3,3,2,3
USER	I also like fantasy movies.		4,4,4,3
SYSTEM	Oh, someone just recommended "Love, Simon (2018)" . I want to see that.		
SYSTEM	I've also heard "Call Me by Your Name  (2017)" is good		
USER	Yes, it was amazing. I really liked how funny it was and it felt like you were right along side him.		3,3,3,3
USER	I Haven't seen "Call Me by Your Name  (2017)" but it also looks very good.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	I don't know if it is similar, but "A Home at the End of the World  (2004)" was pretty good as well		
USER	What is that about?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	As I recall it was about growing up and dealing with trauma		
USER	That sounds similar, I'll check it out.		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	I'm trying to think about fantasy films, but all I can think of right now is the new "Jumanji  (2017)" film		
USER	Was that good?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	It was entertaining, but nothing close to the original		
SYSTEM	I expected it to be much worse		
USER	I loved the original. I think I'll check out the sequel, but nothing can hold a candle.		3,4,3,3
USER	Thanks for your help.		3,4,4,3
SYSTEM	You're welcome		
SYSTEM	I also saw the new one "Ready Player One  (2018)"		
SYSTEM	Had a lot of good '80s references and VR fantasy		
USER	That does look very good, I'll add that to my list too. Have a good night!		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	You too		
SYSTEM	Goodbye		
USER	OVERALL		4,3,4,3

SYSTEM	oh you will love it!

USER	I felt sad for the girl		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hey there!		
USER	I want a movie that my girlfriends and I can go to this weekend. Something that is not a movie our boyfriends would take us to.		3,3,3
USER	Some of us are getting a bit sick of action and superhero movies.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I can understand that. What movies have you seen that you liked?		
USER	I saw "Black Panther (2018)" and didn’t really like it, and nobody else who hasn’t seen it yet wants to see it.		2,3,3
USER	We like "Legally Blonde (2001)" and the other ones in that series.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	What about "Midnight Sun  (2018)" it's a bit of a Romance.		
SYSTEM	There is also "Game Night (2018)" which is supposed to be funny.		
USER	Is it set in Alaska?		2,3,3
USER	Why is it midnight sun?		3,3,3
USER	We did see "Game Night (2018)" and I did like it.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It's about a girl that has a genetic condition which makes her unable to go outside into the sunlight.		
USER	Oh, that makes sense. Did it get good reviews?		2,3,3
SYSTEM	And she falls in love with a guitarist and it runs from there. It got a few good reviews. I think it was mostly overlooked though thanks to all the Marvel and super hero movies popping out left and right.		
USER	I will check that out. Thanks for the suggestions.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Hope that helps!		
USER	Bye.		2,3,3
SYSTEM	Bye		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Hi what kind of movie do you want to see ?		
USER	Hello, I like to watch movies like "It  (2017)" or "@204707," what would you suggest?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	IF you like cars movies I would recommend "Rush  (2013)" , "Days of Thunder (1990)" , "Gone in 60 Seconds  (2000)"		
USER	I have seen most of those movies already. They were pretty good. I also like comedy movies too, I could use a good laugh. What would you suggest for a good laugh?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	as for film similar to "It  (2017)" , I would suggest "The Babadook (2014)" and "The Wailing  (2016)" .		
SYSTEM	The is an old comedy about a race, "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963)"		
USER	I haven't seen "The Babadook (2014)" who are the actors in that movie? Thank you for the suggestion on "The Wailing  (2016)" Ill have to check that one out one of these days.		3,3,3
USER	What about any more recent comedies?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"The Babadook (2014)" is an autralia independent film		
SYSTEM	"Get Out (2017)" is considered a comedy by some		
SYSTEM	and it has also horror		
USER	Ive seen "Get Out (2017)" I didnt think it was that funny at times. I would not have guessed it was a horror also though.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Logan Lucky (2017)" is one of the op 2017 comedies		
USER	What movies just make you feel good and have a good great soundtrack?		3,3,3
USER	Ive never heard of "Logan Lucky (2017)" What is that movie about?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	what kind of soundtrack like "The Blues Brothers  (1980)" , "Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985)" by Philipp Glass, or "Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014)"		
SYSTEM	"Logan Lucky (2017)" is about a heist in a NASCAR race		
USER	I really liked the soundtrack to "Guardians of the Galaxy  (2014)" and "@111429!" What kind of movies can you suggest that are similar to those movies and soundtrackings?		3,4,3
SYSTEM	There is not many sci-fi movies with a 70s soundtrack		
USER	I dont think I would enjoy "Logan Lucky (2017)" if its about nascar, is it a funny movie or more of a serious movie?		3,2,3
SYSTEM	More funny, it is a heist comedy, like "American Hustle (2013)"		
SYSTEM	a film a 70s soundtrack would be "Dazed and Confused  (1993)"		
USER	I did like "American Hustle (2013)" it was pretty good!		3,5,3
USER	"Dazed and Confused  (1993)" who stars in that?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	few young actors ben Affleck and Matthew McConaughey,		
USER	I do like both of those actors. You have had a lot of really good suggestions. Anything else you can think of before I go and curl up with a good movie?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"Kagemusha (1980)" is on Canadian Netflix, it is beautifully filmed		
SYSTEM	Have a nice day		
USER	Thank you goodbye :)		4,3,3

SYSTEM	what about "Jumanji  (2017)"		
USER	I am not a big zombie action fan, such as "The Zombinator (2012)" or "Zombiez (2005)" .		3,3,3
USER	I have yet to see "@83552," only the original!		3,3,2

SYSTEM	okay. Have you seen "Blair Witch  (2016)" ? The remake?		
SYSTEM	Or continuation rather		
USER	I did not. Is it silly like the sequel "Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2 (2000)" ?		2,3,2,3
SYSTEM	It's more of a serious tone like the first film		
SYSTEM	Also, have you seen "@The" Witch (2015)		
USER	I did. It was very good! Much better than "The Conjuring (2013)" !		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	WHAAAT!?! You didn't like "The Conjuring (2013)" I loved it. :)		
USER	Heh, I guess it wasn't that bad! "Insidious  (2011)" was worse! :P		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Definitely Agree!		
USER	I like goofy horror movies when they are meant to be goofy. Like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986)"		3,3,3,3
USER	But bad horror movies are just bad.		2,2,2,3
SYSTEM	I agree. You want to be terrified a bit, not looking at the screen thinking WTF??		
USER	OVERALL		3,3,3,3

USER	Hi		3,3,3
USER	Can you suggest some action movies?		3,3,3
USER	I really enjoyed "Shooter  (2007)" and "@145016."		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Does "The Martian  (2015)" count as action? I loved that one!		
USER	Yes, I think so. It was a great movie!		3,3,4
SYSTEM	What about "Beverly Hills Cop (1984)" ?		
USER	I really liked Matt Damon in "The Bourne Identity  (1988)" and "The Bourne Ultimatum  (2007)" too.		3,2,3
SYSTEM	It's a classic.		
SYSTEM	I think that I missed those, too.		
USER	Yes, even though "Beverly Hills Cop (1984)" was comedic it was full of action. Great one!		3,3,4
USER	You should check out all the Bourne movies. Action packed.		3,3,3

USER	I am hoping for you to give me some recommendations for a comedy		3,3,3,3,3,3
USER	I like "Step Brothers  (2008)" and "The Hangover (2009)" if that is helpful		3,3,3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I heard that "Daddy's Home  (2015)" was funny		
USER	I hated that movie. I did not even crack a smile once		3,3,3,2,3,2
USER	Do you have a different suggestion, perhaps?		2,3,3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Comedy is not my kind of movie...what about "Bad Moms (2016)" ?		
USER	I've never seen that. What is it about?		2,3,3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	It's about moms acting badly...typical		
SYSTEM	I's still stuck with "Elf  (2003)" lol		
USER	I see! I'll have to check it out since I am a mom myself		4,3,4,3,3,4
USER	Elf is my all-time favorite movie! It's just so funny! I just watched it the other night		4,3,4,3,3,4
SYSTEM	I did, too. Also just watched the "Anchorman " again.		
SYSTEM	Sorry, I wish I had more suggestions for you...

SYSTEM	Oh gosh, you subjected her to torture. The last movie I walked out on was "@204409."

USER	Youre doing good, just make sure your movie comes up when you start typing the "@" sign		3,3,3
SYSTEM	"The Blair Witch Project (1999)" This one scared me, because it was set where I grew up,lol!

USER	I think "The Ring  (2002)" was very scary!		3,4,3,3

USER	Have you seen anything interesting lately?		3,3,4
SYSTEM	It's going well.		
SYSTEM	Yes, I have. Have you seen "The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas  (2008)" ?		
SYSTEM	It's a sad movie. "Inglourious Basterds (2009)" I watched that lst night.		
USER	I saw part of it. I need to finish watching that movie but it was difficult to watch. I watched "Hidden Figures (2016)" recently. It was more uplifting, if not as realistic.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I think you might like it.		
USER	Yes I think I will. I'll check that one out. Brad Pitt stars right?		3,3,4
SYSTEM	Yeah, couldn't get into "Hidden Figures (2016)" myself.		
SYSTEM	That's the one		
USER	It was good but I doubt that is really how the story went. I've heard good things about "Inglourious Basterds (2009)" . It reminds me a bit of "Legends of the Fall (1994)"		3,2,3
SYSTEM	Oh yeah...forgot what that movie was about though.		
SYSTEM	I get that one and "Braveheart (1995)" confused for some reason		
USER	They were both inspirational movies where the hero didn't really get the glory. I think that is why they just don't seem right. The good guys don't win.		3,3,4
USER	Thank you for your suggestions and the great conversation.		4,3,4
SYSTEM	You're welcome! Have a good night.

SYSTEM	How about "Midnight Sun  (2018)" or "@205618?"		
SYSTEM	"Winchester (2018)" looks interesting.		
USER	Is "Midnight Sun  (2018)" the love story where she has some disease?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It is.		
USER	I saw the Trailer for "Acrimony (2018)" and it seems a bit creepy.		3,3,3
USER	Is it even out yet?		3,3,3
SYSTEM	It is in my area		
USER	I just checked my theater and "Acrimony (2018)" is released in a couple days.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I'm going to see it in a few weeks.		
USER	"Winchester (2018)" seems creepy too, and it is not out yet.		3,3,3

SYSTEM	Good evening!		
USER	Hello!		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	Whats kind of movies do you like and what have you hated seeing?		
USER	Hated seeing... Let's see.		3,3,3,2
USER	Let me tell you what I like first.		3,3,3,3
USER	Because you asked that first. :)		4,4,3,3
USER	I like classic movies for sure.		3,4,3,4
USER	And I like when they're remastered.		3,3,3,3
USER	But classic cinema, even foreign, is a favorite of mine. Especially if they're classic.		3,3,3,3
USER	I mean, 'celebrated' classics		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	well. here we go then!		
USER	So any Golden Era Hollywood flick.		2,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"The Wizard of Oz  (1939)"		
USER	Genre doesn't matter.		2,2,3,2
SYSTEM	"Casablanca  (1942)"		
USER	Gotta say I love "The Wizard of Oz  (1939)"		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	and of course "@136808!"		
USER	I just saw "Casablanca  (1942)"		3,4,3,3
USER	And that last one was a milestone. Boo Radley. Scout.		3,3,3,3
USER	Gregory Peck was a great actor.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	and course "Titanic  (1997)" is a classic!!!!		
USER	I'd agree that "Titanic (2012)" was a worthy epic		3,4,3,4
USER	I mean, the 1997 version		3,3,3,3
USER	Kate and Leo		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	what about "@166466?"		
USER	I can recite lines from that one.		3,2,3,3
USER	Zuzu's Petals.		3,3,3,3
USER	Hey Bert! My mouth is bleedin! Whoopeeeee!		4,3,4,4
USER	Jimmy Stewart was huge		3,3,4,3
USER	Good suggestions. I am going to go see what's on TCM		3,4,4,3
SYSTEM	aww! yes i love that one i watch it a lot at christmas time with my grandparents		
SYSTEM	have a good night!		
USER	Goodbye! :		3,3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		4,4,3,3

SYSTEM	Hey, Can I help you find a movie?		
USER	Yes please!		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Any specific interest?		
USER	I'm looking for movies that are based on, or include natural disasters.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"The Day After Tomorrow (2004)" I really enjoyed		
USER	I did see that. One of my favorites.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Also "The Perfect Storm  (2000)" was a great ocean disaster movie.		
SYSTEM	"San Andreas  (2015)" and "The Impossible  (2012)" where two other great movies about families caught in extreme natural disasters.		
USER	Oh yes, "The Perfect Storm  (2000)" was based on a true story too. Very sad.		3,3,3,4
SYSTEM	Yes, it was.		
USER	I've never heard of either of them but they sound like exactly what I'm looking for.		3,2,3,3
USER	Have you seen either?		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	"Twister  (1996)" was also really great.		
SYSTEM	I've seen them both, I liked "The Impossible  (2012)" more		
USER	Awesome. Thank you so much. What was the natural disaster?		4,2,4,2
SYSTEM	But they are both really emotionally driving and thought provoking.		
SYSTEM	"The Impossible  (2012)" was a tsunami while a couple was on vacation. I think it was also a true story.		
USER	Thank you so much. You gave excellent suggestions. I really appreciate it.		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Great I hope my recommendations were sufficent, please enjoy.		
SYSTEM	Bye		
USER	Goodbye		3,2,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,2,3,3

USER	Hello, I am seeking movies to watch. I like classics, but I will also watch new films.		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Alright, have you seen "Machete  (2010)" and "Machete Kills (2013)"		
USER	I have not seen them. What kind of movies are they?		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	I'm still waiting for Machete in space		
SYSTEM	The best kind		
USER	with a title like "Machete  (2010)" , it sounds too bloody for me. Is it gory?		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Great for movie night		
USER	What's it about?		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	sure, but it's worth the watch		
SYSTEM	love, hate, revenge		
SYSTEM	betrayal action commedy		
SYSTEM	you'll love it		
USER	Is it terrible? I like bad-good movies, like "The Room  (2003)"		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Maybe you would enjoy something less bloody like "Son of Aladdin (2003)"		
USER	I'm not find of the mediocre. Good or bad, you know&gt;		2,2,3,3
USER	I mean not FOND of.		3,3,4,3
USER	What's "Son of Aladdin (2003)" like?		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	It reminded me of "The Wolf of Wall Street  (2013)"		
USER	In what way?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	Wouldn't think they are similar		
SYSTEM	but I think some of the voices sound the same.		
USER	You have an interesting approach to movies/ Do you like so bad they are good movies?		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	sure		
USER	Do you like over the top musicals?		3,3,4,3
SYSTEM	I love them		
SYSTEM	I think "Tron (1982)" was a musical		
USER	Have you seen "The Apple  (1980)" ? It is astoundly awful, yet super entertaining.		3,3,3,2
USER	astoundingly		4,3,4,3
USER	my typing is terrible today, but my film taste is impeccable, lol		3,3,3,2
SYSTEM	Great, do you have what you need?		
USER	I think so. Nice talking to you.		4,3,3,3
USER	OVERALL		3,3,4,3

USER	hello		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Good morning. I'd like to help you find a movie if that would be okay with you.		
USER	i am looking for a scary film please		4,3,3,3
USER	I loved "It  (2017)" but hated "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)"		4,3,3,3
SYSTEM	Oh scary movies are the best. When asked for scary I always go with "The Shining  (1980)" with Jack Nicholson.		
USER	That was a great film I agree.		4,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I wasn't too much on the chain saw massacre's either. I didn't think they made much sense.		
USER	I don't like gore, I like scary		3,2,3,3
SYSTEM	Have you seen "Mother! (2017)" It stars Jennifer Lawrence. It's more of a thriller, kind of like The Shining.		
SYSTEM	Yes, me too. Makes you wonder how they're gonna get out of there.		
USER	No, I have not seen that. I liked her in "The Hunger Games  (2012)"		3,2,3,3
USER	that sounds like a good film to me		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	Yes, I liked the Hunger Games. I just recently caught that one.		
SYSTEM	Okay great. I&quot;m glad I was able to help.		
SYSTEM	Goodbye.

USER	OVERALL		3,2,3,3

SYSTEM	good evening		
USER	hi		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	can I find a movie you might like?		
USER	anything horror		3,4,3,3
SYSTEM	I liked "An American Werewolf in London (1981)"		
USER	Exactly i loved that too		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	"An American Werewolf in Paris (1997)" was pretty good too but not as good as the first		
USER	and "Underworld  (2003)"		3,3,3,3

SYSTEM	I like how other countries vs the US does horror		
USER	yeah, well they al don't have Hollywood		3,3,3,3
USER	yeah big difference		3,3,3,3
USER	in outcome		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	I find that other nation's horror is both more subtle and yet more expressive. less special effects		
SYSTEM	I tend to find them more horrifying		
USER	yeah kinda like how the 80's were in the US		3,3,3,3
USER	not very visual		3,3,2,2
USER	but made you invision the horror		3,3,2,3
SYSTEM	yes.		
SYSTEM	did you ever see "Nosferatu (1922)"		
SYSTEM	the visuals are some of the best most horrifying vampires I've ever seen		
USER	no, i haven't		3,3,3,2
USER	wow sounds good for a 20's movie		3,3,3,3
SYSTEM	check it out simply for black and white horror depiction of vampire. not romantic or glamorous		
SYSTEM	but spooky!

USER	I also like movies like "Up  (2009)" and "Inside Out  (2015)" . They are so cute and have a really good message		3,3,3

USER	I'm well thanks!		3,3,3
SYSTEM	So I heard you are interested in movies!		
SYSTEM	Let's start off with some genres that you like?		
USER	My wife and I are looking on Netflix tonight. Have you seen "Dallas Buyers Club (2013)" ?		3,3,3
USER	I like historical, science fiction, and action		2,3,3
SYSTEM	Sorry, I have not.		
SYSTEM	Hmm.... Let's see.		
USER	Have you seen "Lost in Space  (1998)" ?		2,3,3
SYSTEM	Sorry, Im looking at Netflix to see if I ca assist with finding you movies in that genre that I've enjoyed.		
USER	What do you like?		3,3,2
SYSTEM	Yes I have seen that movie, and I rather disliked it. The movie "Lost in Space  (1998)" was not all that attention grabbing.		
USER	Gotcha. Good to know.		3,3,2
SYSTEM	I'm more interested in the horror genre, sci-fi, all that jazz!		
USER	I see		3,3,2
USER	I don't really get into horror		2,3,2
SYSTEM	Sorry about me taking too long to assist with finding a movie.		
SYSTEM	One moment please.		
SYSTEM	Have you ever seen "@78634?"		
USER	Hmmm no actually.		3,3,3
USER	Is it good?		2,3,2
SYSTEM	I enjoyed both the novel and the movie. I greatly recommend it for sci-fi lovers.		
USER	I'll make note of that		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Aside from movies, a really good show in Netflix I'd recommend is Black Mirror.		
USER	OK		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Each episode is a different story and it focuses on the future of technology and how it could go wrong in the future.		
USER	Any other movie suggestions?		3,3,3
USER	I'll check out Black Mirror		2,3,3
USER	It does sound interesting		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Yeah, I really enjoyed it! The first season is alright but the 3rd and 4th season I really enjoyed		
SYSTEM	Each episode is different so there's variety in the show. It's definitely a show that makes you sit down and think for a while after watching.		
SYSTEM	Hope you enjoy! :)		
USER	Thanks!		2,3,3
USER	Did you see "The Descent (2005)"		3,3,3
USER	Scariest movie I ever saw		2,3,3
SYSTEM	Yes, I have! Funny story, I watched that movie during a thnderstorm with my sister at home and as seen as we finished it the power went out		
SYSTEM	Talk about scary, haha!		
USER	I didn't want to turn out the lights after thatone.		3,3,3
SYSTEM	I didn't have a choice! Sadly...		
SYSTEM	Have you ever seen "@190170?"		
USER	Nope.		3,3,2
USER	I'd be down to check it out if it's not too jumpy.		2,3,2
SYSTEM	Well, if you don't like horror. Japanese horror is even more scary		
USER	That's what I've heard.		3,3,3

USER	it sounds like it is a sad one		3,3,3
SYSTEM	One of my absolute favorites is "The Game  (1997)"		
USER	yes the game, i have seen and i think it was awesome		3,3,3
SYSTEM	Falling Down is not really sad. It is drama with some surprise points		
SYSTEM	"The Wicker Man  (1973)" is really good; much better than the remake
